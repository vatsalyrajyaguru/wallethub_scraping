Today I wanted info on the \u201cplan it\u201d program thru Amex that allows big ticket purchases (like a refrigerator -$3000) with no interest &amp; paid off over 12 months. Seemed simple. 34 minutes of frustration later, talking with \u201cJohnny\u201d in India\u2026..and I was ready to scream!!  Dude had no clue yet what I was calling for. So I ask for a USA based rep or a supervisor. I get the USA based rep and explain all the previous nonsense to him and he assures me that he will send my call to a specialist in the USA that can help me\u2026\u2026.I am not kidding when I say \u2026..he transfers my call back to India!!! After some snarky comments by me, the chick says \u201c\u201dlet\u2019s keep it professional please\u201d and there I lost my $&amp;?% and just hung up, then I cut my Amex card up with the scissors. When I spend 30k+ per year on a card (for points) I can have a lot of patience\u2026\u2026no more Amex India BS for this guy!</p>",

The customer service rep said even if they re-issue me a new card with the last four numbers, being the same any reoccurring charges would still be billed in the future to my card. Very poor customer service. I don\u2019t understand why they even have customer service if they won\u2019t issue a dispute and I have to do all of this myself.

The balance was immediately paid in full since we did not want to deal with this horrible service ever again. 90 days later I just received a bill with $1.64 interest charge and a new balance of $1.64, when I called it was told that there was 'Trailing intrest\" on this account. We still never received cards and are being told by Lowes we do not have an account. The account that doesn't exist was closed today. This is the worst experience we have ever had with a credit card company. As a contractor we would have been a medium sized corporate account with incentives to deal with Lowes. Based on this experience we opened a Home Depot account instead.</p>",

I was not able to enter the Centurion Lounge, they want a Boarding Pass that is less than 3 hours and my airline doesn't assign me a seat until last minute on the boarding process. So there's no way to visit the lounge unless I miss my flight. Also from 10 people trying to enter only around 4 made it because they have so many dumb unexplicable rules. So don't think that because you have the card you will be able to visit the lounge. NO they have 1 million tricks to say NO.<br />Then I said, let's try the Priority Pass because I can eat in Miami Airport! Guess what??? The Restaurant in Miami Airport don't take Priority Pass from American Express. I was like whattttt???? Anyway I called the line for help and the guy was like yeahhh Priority Pass is not available everywhere, I ask if can I get a credit and they said NO Again! So anyway I just canceled the Amazing AMEX Super Platinum Useless Card. Thanks for nothing AMEX.<br />PD: Fix the Centurion Lounge Rules and the Priority Pass then call me and I will join again. So far your card is not usable.<br />Thanks for nothing!<br />Emmanuel Orona Cruz</p>",

The time comes where I meet the spend and I only see 80k in my account. It takes months and all Eric, the manager, could offer was if I just spend $10k a month till November, I could make up those points. It has been a hassle and I feel bait and switched. I don't use Walmart+ and Equinox is so expensive that it is not even worth it since its cheaper to get a Equinox membership through Perkspot.</p>",

Now, keep in mind I had made payments so it was not past due or anything like that. So I would be very cautious with them and once I pay the total balance I am gone will never use them again.

I asked if I should submit documentation proving the sub par software I subscribed, she told me they\u2019ll reach out if needed. After a month, I received communication that the vendor has provided the contract I subscribed for a year and I have to pay for the entire year. Period.

        "content": "<p>American Express has always been my go-to card until now.  I recently charged $3500 in travel to my card.  Receiving my statement in the mail, I called to redeem travel points.  That was when the Customer NO Service began.  After being on the phone for over 50 minutes, I was told that I could only redeem $500 even though I had additional points available to redeem.  The front line person could not tell me why I couldn\u2019t redeem additional points.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, but they were obviously so busy dealing with other unhappy customers, that after waiting 30 minutes there were still no available supervisors.  From my point of view, I use the card as my main card, I earn points, American Express benefits from my usage of their card, and I should be able to redeem the points I\u2019ve earned.  In addition, I asked the front line person if I should short pay the current statement or wait for the credit to show up on my next statement.  She told me that I could short pay the current statement, however, after further questioning, she told me that short paying the current statement would subject me to fees and interest.  That would have been important information that should have been shared without me asking. Not impressed at all.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Worst Customer service <br /><br /><br>This company randomly and often adds \"security alerts\" to the cards, so when one calls to use the very expensive services (platinum cards are $695 a year) they have to call you back and check thru recent purchases. EVERY SINGLE TIME they transfer you to a new department they make you go through the process all over again. Then line drops and you will have to do it AGAIN!  <br /><br>Go to use the card at a store and you will be declined for NO REASON even after you have completed these security checks and it wont be resolved for 24 hours! All of this for my protection after being a perfect customer for 33 years!<br /><br>Imagine being a grocery story with a cart full of frozen and perishable food and being declined with no resolution bcz the supervisor at Amex REFUSES to get on the line. One hour of wasted time!!!</p>",

This is the dumbest practice in history! It's a true Racket!!! Don't be like me and just pay, look at your bill and make sure you're not getting hit with late fees even though you have paid above and beyond any minimum payment twice in a month every month forever! ridiculous!</p>",

I guess I used it too aggressively because I am being threatened with my account being closed or pay $1110.00 for the first payment. I only have about a $4000.00 balance. I have a card that is $23000 and a card that's $14000. I pay my bills and other than that I don't see why it was necessary to run my credit (hard/soft) hit over a funky $4000.00. We are doing upgrades and preparing for vacation. But thank you Amex, I realized in this whole ordeal my interest rate with you is the highest sooooo, you've made the decision for me. I shredded the card and will be paying it off to never use again. By the time you close out my account in the future my 780 credit score will be restored. I also purchased 3 Acura's in the past 2.5 years totaling approximately $200,000. So there are many factors as to why my score recently dropped and none are because my payment history. Goodbye and good riddance!!!</p>",

Then making threats about wanting to cancel  saying I already committed to the agreement and the best he could do was push it out a few days but I\u2019d still have to pay the settlement amount. Customer service is so untrustworthy and crooks. I then asked for email confirmation and he told me he couldn\u2019t provide me with that.

        "content": "<p>I had an Amex card for my business and I was happy to use it for buying supplies and balancing the amount the following month. This worked well as my clients paid my invoice and in turn I cleared the Amex balance. Then 2 issues happened: 1, I raised a charge back request in October 2022, which was acknowledged in writing and then I had a letter a week later saying it was closed stating I had not responded. I had. 2, In November 2022 I had a client inform me that due to Christmas payment runs differing from the rest of the year, they were delaying my invoice by a week. No problem I thought, just call Amex and arrange a one off exception to pay 1 week later, considering I had never missed a payment or paid late, this should be fine? Wrong. Amex immediately classified my account as a risk, and blocked my card and it never worked again. I called them multiple times to ask why, and they said the card would be unblocked, it wasn't. I cleared the December payment exactly when I promised to, but the account remained blocked. Multiple calls later, they kept promising to unblock the card, but never did. Eventually, I called to make a complaint, which wasn't taken seriously, nobody gave me a reference number or acknowledged anything formally. I called again, about the 6th time, to say \"Either acknowledge these issues, fix my card and apologise, or close my account\". This was recorded on the Amex system as \"customer wants to close the account\". That wasn't what I said, but Amex only believe their own records. Do not bother calling and trying to reason with them, they just write whatever they feel like in their system and usually it tries to make you out as the bad guy.<br /><br /><br>I am now in dispute with them, and they want to close my account and demand full payment of all funds outstanding. They have never acknowledged any error on their part, its all my fault apparently. Be very sure that Amex will not do anything to assist if you run into issues</p>",

        "content": "<p>WARNING!!  BEFORE considering business with Amex, you should know how shiesty they operate. They hide from and prey upon their own loyal customers! One department will tell you to do something causing another department to condemn you for it without explanation! Twice now this has happened before I finally realized they are fighting amongst themselves without care of the affect it has on their customers. First time I managed to look over it, second time I froze the account and will close it as soon as it's paid in full. I've been a loyal card holder for over 5 years, I have never been late and have an excellent credit rating, a couple of years ago, I had a balance of $3,000 with a credit limit of $20,000 and I received a threat of having my limit dropped if I didn't give them $950. (Reminder: I have NEVER been late with a payment)  But just to keep my limit I went ahead and paid them the $950 and was told I'd not ever have to pay that again. I was LIED to, January 14th 23 I recieved an email demanding another $950 within 3 days or they'd cut my limit (I have still not ever been late with payment and I think my balance is a Lil over $2,000) so I contacted them on the 14th and was told that's not right and for me to ignore it and forward it to an address he gave me, thus I did what he said. Haven't heard a thing till today 1-21-22, I get an email saying future transactions may be declined because of limit drop. Ok enough is enough, I've done EVERYTHING Amex has told me to do and I'm still getting punished! I called and have not yet gotten an understandable explanation as to why this is even a situation or even a remedy, only one department blaming another. They have been so shiesty with all this I fear having any type of dealings with them, cuz with no doubt those kind of ethics they can be doing just about anything with your account and you never knowing . All that I've said is recorded and copied if anyone would like to see that I've stated only the truth</p>",

Last month without notice they took my limit on my Reserve card from $75,000 to $3,100.  Took me from unlimited limits on my Platinum to $36,000 and $3,100 on my Gold Card.  For about the past 15 years I have paid my rent for my business with my American Express card.   They never had an issue until this year when I hit the spending threshold on my Reserve Card to make Diamond with Delta.  They are accusing me of owning the office and the rent I pay not being real.  It\u2019s public record that I do not own the building, yet a month later this isn\u2019t resolved.  In the meantime I\u2019ve canceled my Gold card that I never use.  I don\u2019t know how they think I\u2019m supposed to be able to run a business with a $3,100 limit when many advertising charges can be $5k-$12k transactions each.  I\u2019ve had to switch over to using my Chase Sapphire Business card for most purchases to keep the card from maxing out daily.  I can\u2019t believe they would treat someone who has been with them this long like this!!</p>",

And even better, it has helped me forge a relationship with AMEX that has unlocked for me all the company has to offer. No annual fee, decent 3% across the board, easy Plan It* payment option, and credit limit increases are easily obtained on request. Its just a solid addition to your credit card portfolio</p>",

        "content": "<p>Not a credit card, more like a monthly expense account. If you go with 5% back then the ENTIRE balance must be settled every month. Anything not settled will be subject to ridiculously high fees and a possible hit to your credit like you paid nothing. NO WHERE is this disclosed unless you read the very fine print, which you'll have to dig to find even.  I can't even imagine how many people got this thinking it was a real credit card with min payments, only to be screwed to the wall at the end of the month when the whole balance was suddenly due. OR you can pay it off over 90 days and get no rewards. There is literally no reason I can think of to get this card. Let's don't even get into how horrible Amex is as a company or how few places you will find that actually accept it. Such a scam. DON'T DO IT, TRUST ME!!!!!!</p>",

You have to hunt for the phone numbers as they are hidden somewhere in AMEX mismanagement!; <br /><br>6) No benefit for having the AMEX checking related to acquiring an AMEX business cc!; <br /><br>7) the only benefit I can see is relatively free with limited charges for business expenses.

So I just cut the card off as we purchased a lake house last month ( paid cash) paid for all the furniture and a medical procedure so we ran up a 98k balance on the card. We have had autopay setup on the account to pay balance in full as long as I can remember. We have never revolved on any credit card, we pay balance in full on whatever we charge. AmEx cut my card off and demanded I make a payment, which I paid them 50k. When it cleared I called them up and asked them to bump my credit limit from 50k to 75k, they refused!! If I\u2019m not the top 1% of the top 1% of all their customers, they might as well lock the door behind them. Best of luck to them but they won\u2019t be getting my business!</p>",

I entered the wrong spelling of my business on DMA to stop it, and now they just use another variation. I am so frustrated and will never be an American Express customer because they are sleezy!

        "content": "<p>I recently received my platinum card and was excited to get 5X points for my hotel reservation if I book through AmEx Travel.  Easy process.  Great price.  Done.  Here was the result.  They use Expedia to book the reservation.  I cannot use my Hilton app to check in nor pick my room as they would not honor my Diamond status due to booking through Expedia.   The Hilton rep must have mentioned Expedia three times during the check-in process to make feel small.  But because she was so nice she \"allowed me 2 bottles of water even though I booked through Expedia because of Diamond status.\"  If there was an executive lounge, I would not have been given access.  The worst occurred when I checked out.  I asked for my receipt as this was a business expense.  They told me it would come from Expedia.  Not.  I called AmEx Travel and initially was told they could not provide a receipt but only a \"confirmation.\"  After 20 minutes, I was sent an email with the total but it was not itemized.  Finally after 30 minutes a very crude itemized receipt was mailed.  I pray my company accepts this. Bottom line:  the treatment of being by the hotel for booking through Expedia, the lack of any status perks due to booking through Expedia and finally the hassle of getting an itemized receipt due to using Expedia . . . so not worth it.  Will never do this again.</p>",

Payments do not go through leading to interest charges on unbilled charges. Even after your statement balance is paid in full you will receive  trailing interest charges. Per their statement, interest will be charged \"even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges\". When you call customer service or use their chat system you are often disconnected or get the run around. Not the service expected especially when paying high membership fees.</p>",

For some reason their website wouldn\u2019t give me the option to do so. I then called American Express to get their help booking the flight. The agent I spoke with said he didn\u2019t have the option at the moment to pay with points and he confirmed if I payed with my card right now I could call back later and they could convert the payment to the points I have. I confirmed again with him that I would have no issues doing so and he said it would absolutely be able to be converted. So I booked it and sure enough I call in to try to convert the payment to points and everyone says I am unable to do so. Now I have a very large amount of unused points and had to pay with my credit card. I have been an American Express member for years, but am very disappointed by this and know that Chase Sapphire seemed to have a much better process. Disappointed</p>",

They gave me the hilton points and statement credit that was on the offer but not the 0 percent apr which was the main deal for me. I had to go through a two month dispute, even mailing them a hard copy of my promotion as they dont except email or fax and they came up with an excuse that they found they did nothing wrong. When I asked I need an explanation customer service just repeated me some script about subject to change and credit history, etc.. None of that should had applied to me. I gave up fighting and just paid the balance, closed out my card completely. Never applying with American Express again. Never had an issue with other credit card companies.</p>",

And it halted us from miles to fly our two foster kids to see family in the Midwest.

Noticed the miles were not deposited into my Delta account in the 3-month timeframe and called....and called...and called....and called.  Got 4 different answers and uncertainty why I didn't get the miles.  Finally after two months, after the 5th call, I was told by a manager about the Venmo loophole.  I asked how I was expected to understand said rule if 4 of their own employees didn't know the same rule?  I was then accused by the manager of wanting them to falsify records.  I said no, I just want the miles promised and would even complete the $150 spend left after taking out the Venmo debacle and that I just wanted the miles for our foster kids.  Nope.  No go. No flexibility.  So I canceled the card and am warning all of you out there.</p>",

I do have other cards including APPLE card and Chase with 10 times the limit of AMEX and they are awesome compared to AMEX. Actually this should be a 0 STARS for them.<br /><br>My other cards have $600 fee yearly but you have to be on the phone for 10 minutes before you can speak to live person.<br /><br>One time I made a large payment on AMEX, trying to book a vacation.<br /><br>I could not pay for the trip on the site. It will keep declining. Called AMEX that had the audacity to question having money in the bank to cover that payment. Agent on the phone called my personal bank to verify I had enough funds to cover that purchase before AMEX let me go ahead and book the trip.<br /><br>I got many other stories about this company but time is most precious thing that I got.<br /><br>My recommendation stay away from this company as far as possible. If you want to be treated like **** and feel bad later bout your decisions this is the time to make a smart choice. There is plenty of other Credit Companies you can do business with.<br /><br>Stay away from people that do not appreciate your business and do not know how to make you feel appreciated. <br /><br>This is coming from someone who has had paid 100% on time credit cards for 15 years or longer. At one point my credit score was 800 and I was making close to 200K.<br /><br>This is my 2 cents trying to help ppl out there as much as I can so you don't make the mistakes I have made when I chose AMEX.</p>",

For a platinum member  that paid $300/year per card and when the card gets lost of stolen it takes over 2 days to be deliver...it is ridiculous.  Spoke with a Representative called Tatianna that indicate to me that she has the same authority as a Manager.  Really?  Manager in a 500 Fortune company has the same authority that a regular employee? Wait for about 30 minutes without a manager taking the courtesy of picking up the phone to explain a policy to me.  They are good to charge you the $300/year but when you have a question you are on your own.  Even my bank deliver a Debit card within 24 hours and I paid zero fee a year.  Again, American Express needs to understand that when a client request help and ask for a supervisor, that the supervisor should take sometime to understand the inquiry that the member have and answer that call, not dismiss the person and be treated like a 2nd class citizen.</p>",

Half a dozen of my other credit cards started at four times that amount.  If my credit score hadn't already taken a hit because of this cheap card,  I would've cut it in half and returned it. <br /><br>The card arrived with another accompanying letter announcing \"discontinuation\" of several benefits which I haven't had time to read.  THIS IS BAIT AND SWITCH and against the law !   If they can write a letter WITH the card to take benefits away, they can update/correct the tall tale of benefits on their own website at the first place.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Opened the card in September with 746TU 745EQ 735EXP. Was approved for the card with a $1000 limit which was weird after being approved for CSP with an $13,400 limit. Also, the threshold for the bonus was $2000. But I went with it. Used it for gas food and some hotels, paid it off as soon as I used it or paid balance in full before statement closing. In December, I requested a CL increase and was bumped to $5000. Kept paying and using similar. In June was bumped to $10,000. So yes......slow start on the card but with proper use and payments you will get the better limits. <br /><br /><br>Earning 12x at hotels is great especially when combined with Gold (which you get automatically with the card) or Diamond status. You basically end up earning 32x/$1. Plus Hilton has great bonuses like double points or triple points if you use their card (which adds up to around 54x. They add up quick! <br /><br /><br>Use it for gas, food shopping and dining and earn 6x per dollar. If you drive and buy groceries, again, adds up quickly.<br /><br /><br>When you hit $15k, the free night certificate has no point limit so you can use it for a night in any market for even the fanciest hotels (Conrad, Waldorf, etc.)<br /><br /><br>The $95/year isn't bad for the perks at all. Including 10 priority pass uses per year. And alot of the AMEX Offers are pretty useful.<br /><br /><br>Perks are pretty great. I would definitely give the card at least a 4.5/5.</p>",

Yes, the annual fee is high, but after getting companion certificates, TSA precheck, CLEAR access, no-fee baggage, lounge guest passes and lounge access, the $550 is TOTALLY worth it. <br /><br /><br>I travel about once every 2 months (so not frequent, but enough) and hate waiting by the gates. Lounges are totally worth it. You get great complimentary food and drink, comfortable seating, wifi and even showers. It really makes travelling enjoyable. LAX has re-opened the Centurion Lounge and I cannot wait to check it out this month. <br /><br /><br>AMEX customer service has always been superb for me. They are not perfect, but I would rate them much better than most. <br /><br /><br>I did get to use my companion certificates this year (in late August) and that has been worth the annual fee alone. Airfares are through the roof right now. I got 2-round trip tickets from LAX to MIA for under $160 (air tax?) I also used the card's miles for a later trip to Miami and paid a total of $448 for two round-trip tickets coast-to-coast.<br /><br /><br>My only complaint is that Delta's 787 Dreamliner order was cancelled. Flying those jetliners across the country are such a joy but I guess I have to fly American if I want to fly on those.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I received a voucher from Delta in the mail during the first week of May 2022 with an offer to earn 65,000 bonus miles instead of the 40,000 miles after spending $2,000 in eligible purchases during the first three months. The offer also mentioned my full name as well as my Skymiles and said to apply today using my SkyMiles numbers (please see attached pictures). <br /><br /><br>I followed what the offer said and got approved for a Delta American Express Gold card. I spent the $2,000 as needed and got my credit card in the mail before the offer ended which was 06.08.2022. However, I logged onto my delta account and only saw 40,000 miles credited into my SkyMiles. I contacted the customer service line for Delta and they instructed me to call the customer service line for American Express. I proceeded to call American Express and customer service said they'll open an investigation and asked for my POID number which I gave to them. Nothing happened and I called again after 15 days to follow up. They asked me for POID number again which I gave and they said they will investigate again. I called for a third time and asked to speak to a supervisor, he said his name is Diego (employee number ###4164) and he gave me the most incomprehensible, unreasonable, unexplainable answer. He said the offer was not found and he was not able to tell me what the voucher I received means or where is it coming from. I offered to take photos and email him the voucher I got in the mail, and he declined. The worst part about all of this is he said \"you could be saying anything\" regarding the voucher even though I had it in hand. I asked if I could escalate it and he said \"there is nothing we can do\", and then I asked to speak to his supervisor and he refused. It sounded like his answers were inconsistent. <br /><br /><br>In brief, I received a letter with a promotion from Delta and I applied by following the exact instruction, but Amex was not able to honor the promotion they promised their customer, and refused to investigate the matter whilst being rude and unprofessional. I guess I don't understand why Delta and Amex could lie to their customer and could not fulfill 25,000 mile difference which is around $250. I believe this is an absolute fraud. I want to express my disappointment and frustration with a big company like this for lying to me and refusing to offer to help. And I hope people reading this don't ever do business with them.</p>",

        "content": "<p>American Express is my go to credit card. If I could only choose to keep one card in my wallet this would be it. Some may ask if that\u2019s a viable first choice as you have to pay the balance in full each month, but AMEX has come a long way and you do have many choices now. Although I do always pay in full each month so that doesn\u2019t matter much to me. What does matter is their level of customer service. You can tell that they love to keep their customers happy and I for one have only had over the top, wow me, amazing experiences. Everytime I need a dispute\u2026hands down BEST! They make it painless. They make everything SIMPLE. I have four Amex cards. Gold is my favorite because of all the perks and did I mention ease of use?! The Uber Eats and Grubhub dining credits alone pay for the annual fee. So yes. I will continue to be an AMEX fan girl for life. ??</p>",

They penalize you for not charging up high balances and paying them off on a monthly basis. They are no longer beneficial to me, many other cards out there that have more to offer.</p>",

When I was sent a new card for my Amex every day card, I called and found out that my platinum card was still open.<br /><br>    My son and his 3 young children recently moved in with me, because his wife has post pardon psychosis. He is working full time while the kids are in daycare, which that in itself was an obstacle he just overcame. His kids have seen thier mom deteriorate the past 18 months and seeing her less and less. I added my son to my account and I was impressed with how easy that was. Ever since the 3 cards, 2 for my account and 1 for his and mine arrived it has been by far the worst bank/ credit/ even financial situation I have ever experienced. I have tried to buy my grandson a Nintendo switch 3 times all getting declined, after speaking each time to a representative for over an hour verifying who I am. Each time being promised after that it wouldn't happen again. They shut off all 3 cards yesterday. My son got declined at Wendy's for $14 charge and couldn't buy his kids a four for four.  I am going to send them back the notarized signature and close all my accounts. I never imagined this company I have used for so long has treated me and my family with such disrespect, and disregard for my concerns. I don't even want explanation. . I'll be just fine, my C.S. is a 793. Just thought you might like to know.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Multiple card holder for last 20 years. Excellent credit. Cards paid in whole monthly. $10 paid in interest, ever.  Was $200 low on a due date, the \u201coverdraft\u201d attempt cost $39/day and went on 10 days with no contact from AMEX. Only got a letter in the snail-mail 10 days later saying they tried to charge X amount on the 1st due date, and I had insufficient funds. I don\u2019t babysit these things, they\u2019re automatic and I\u2019m used to humans and banks that put a bit of effort in. Anyway, I immediately logged in and paid it off in whole, as I would have 5 min after any potential text notification. Come to find out I was charged 39/day x 10 days overdraft fees and nearly $500 in penalty interest over the next 3 statements. No call, no text, no notifications?  What in the h*ll kind of interest rate costs me $500 in 10 days anyway? Sure isn\u2019t the APR I signed up for. That\u2019s more like the APR changed into a MPR. Hours on the phone with them multiple times asking for an explanation of business practices, simple decency and charges resulted in 2/3 of the charges removed and no sensical answers to the rest. If I have to call this company one more time, it\u2019s over for me. Benefits be da**ed. That was a bunch of nonsense, on a level I\u2019ve never experienced.</p>",

I don\u2019t make late payments and I\u2019ve paid everything on time. Because I recently bought a new house I was denied credit because of \u201ctoo many \u201c inquiries into my credit report. If you know anything about buying a new home and getting insurance for the home,  switching  automobile insurance,  then you know that your credit is hit  a lot. Which you have no control over. It\u2019s pathetic that this company thanks that they\u2019re so good when I have  14 other credit cards and an open line of $20,000 in credit and they treated me like trash when I applied for their cheap card!  Don\u2019t waste your time ! Go to credit a card company that deserves you. I called customer service and they just hung up  on me so obviously when I told him I didn\u2019t need his credit card that I just wanted to let them know that I was disappointed that I they didn\u2019t  really do a accurate check on me before the denial letter and I was offended at their accuracy and customer service. The manager \u201cdiva(he said that was his name) hung up on me! ? I think it\u2019s hilarious an American Express is one big joke. I\u2019ll stick with my Discover card any day !</p>",

I almost had a heart attack. <br /><br /><br>I called them immediately and explained to them that I must have been distracted and forgot to pay them. (I figured out later that I double-paid my platinum AMEX) NO PROBLEM. They credited me the $29 late charge and wiped away the note that I was late. They were sympathetic and compassionate. I think this service is hard to come by--- the CSR actually asked me how my husband was doing! Being part of the AMEX family is an awesome thing. Yes, the yearly fee is high. But if you take advantage of the perks, this card pays for itself. <br /><br /><br>It's a great feeling when you know that AMEX has your back in case of an emergency.</p>",

I have had a legitimate dispute that has dragged on since December with multiple resolutions ruling against the dispute.  The commonality is that the AMEX person that happens to pick up the case never fully reads it and their resolution comments are totally inaccurate.  Simple case:  bought goods and the vendor deliverd them damaged.  Simple, right?  Not for AMEX.  Why do I continue to pay $500/year for this card when AMEX doesnt have my back.   This has cost me hours on the phone waiting then re-explaining to each new rep that picks up the phone.  I have tried to find and speak to he people in charge with no luck.  NEVER again.  Get it together AMEX; it wasnt always like this.  Outsourcing platinum CS to Guadalajara, great plan guys.</p>",

Then approx. 2 years ago they jacked it to 22.24% for no logical reason.  All this time my credit rating was over 700.   When this happened, I transferred what balance I had to two other cards with either 0% - 3.9% promo rates.   Early this year, 2022, I had no choice but to put aprox. $3,300 in medical expenses on the card.  For the first 2 months the rate was 22.24%, but this month with no explanation the rate went to 22.74% with no explanation and my minimum payment is actually higher this month, for 6/22 than it had been even though I had reduced the balance due by about $200.  If I can get out from under I will again at the soonest opportunity and would never recommend American Express to anyone.</p>",

When I went to contact customer service once again, I was told I was declined. Don't you love being told something by one employee, just to be told another thing by another? The economy is getting bad, and they can't help out long time customers all of a sudden? Capital One, Discover, and Target were more understanding and waived my late fees. There is nothing specifically special about AMEX in the end. Don't waste your time with AMEX.</p>",

How embarrassing it would have been if i was at a hotel or restaurant. I have Never been late and had utilized 15 percent of the limit, plus I have excellent credit. So I immediately made a $1000 payment and my limit went back to $6400 a week later. But they reduced my available cash down from $1800 to $200. Message Received.

We worked tirelessly to upholster your customers sofa. We sent pictures of his sofa before we upholstered it and afterwards, with date stamped text messages of when he picked up and dropped off his sofa. We lost over $2000, which is a felony in Maryland. Your customer Samuel Dewitt waited 4.5 months to dispute the charges with no evidence other than his word that he didn\u2019t receive it. And you, @americanexpress helped him to do it. Your business is an accessory to his crimes. What you have done to us is hurtful and criminal. Your business is no better than the criminal that you just helped steal from us. So sickening to treat a small business this way, and to totally disregard compelling evidence in favor of your lying, thieving customer. @americanexpress should be ashamed of themselves for what you have done.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I often wondered why fewer and fewer  retailers accept the card until I started accepting the card for construction. I paid the higher credit card processing fees without complaints.  For a while all seemed fine. Then a first ever charge back for a significant job occurred. Without warning or reason $12k disappeared from our account.  The customer was running out of he late husband\u2019s life insurance and decidedly to finish the work by defrauding contractors. We provided documentation and have now waited three weeks while the same customer struck again for an invoice 126 day old   We will win it also after we go to court file liens etc   But Amex offers the merchants NO protection just a quick theft from an account without reason. We will no longer accept Amex blue black gold or green not even a platinum. They are worse than bad check writers. In 40 years I have never been scammed by a customer like this and have had less than 6 customers stiff us in 40 years.  Amex you might want to join the customer in celebrating the snatch with a bottle of vodka and snorting a line but it will be short lived</p>",

In other words they want you to pay it off within the month. However for larger purchases they do offer payment plans, I\u2019ll be at very simple fixed rate with 12 payments/one year. Points are pretty generous and you can use the points converted to cash at some shops like Amazon. There are always lots of offers for shops, travel etc.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is an OK card overall but in 2022 there are lot of similar, better cards I'd take over this one. The real reason I believe most people (including myself) get this card is because it is effectively the starter card for building a relationship with Amex. Two good reasons to do that. One being Amex will only ever do a hard credit pull on you once (on your first approved card with them), so getting another card with Amex is a lot less risky to your credit than with other issuers. This is kinda nice for if you're going for something like a Gold/Platinum setup in the future. The other is that being in Amex earns you a LOT of exclusive offers, most of which you will probably never use even if you're a turbo-shopaholic. But these include many of the bigger shopping retailers like Adidas and Uniqlo.<br /><br /><br>If the above is important to you, then the BCE is a decent choice. But the perks themselves like the 3% back on groceries also exist on similar cards like the Chase Freedom Flex and Capital One SavorOne, with more competitive benefits and no minimum rewards redemption (compared with the BCE where annoyingly, you need to have at least $25 in cashback rewards to redeem it). I've since upgraded to the BC Preferred since it has a 6% groceries cashback, but it does carry the caveat of a $95 annual fee.</p>",

I stopped using the card a long time ago and they do not have a way to prove that I owe any of it. They cannot go back more than 9 months of your history. That is absurd. You can never speak to the same representative. What a sham of a company. Get a card with any other company, but American Express to trust your charges and disputes with. I hope it catches up to them. No wonder costco dropped them a long time ago! Visa stands by their customers!!!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Three months ago I requested American Express to dispute a charge from Hertz car rental.  After supplying American Express the documents I received at the Hertz rental desk and those I received when I made that charge through a third party discounter  AND written details of the happenstance of how I was overcharged, American Express opened a Dispute for me. <br /><br>A few weeks later American Express informed me Hertz answered their inquiry by sending them copies of my rental documents and Hertz's decision that the charge was valid. American Express then closed the dispute and sent me that decision and those copies of the rental documents Hertz supplied.<br /><br>The items  American Express supplied to me that they said Hertz provided to them did not include all those I supplied that displayed Hertz's overcharge. American Express basically ignored my claim and supported Hertz's overcharge that was very clearly evident on my rental documents. I requested American Express to reopen the Dispute and they did.<br /><br>The same response from Hertz was given to American Express again and I requested the dispute be reopened - twice more! Roughly 3 weeks went by for each of these disputes. Each additional time American Express ruled for Hertz - IGNORING my paperwork and documentation that was more complete. American Express totally ignored the documentation I supplied them from the rental car discounter who in fact made the rental with Hertz for me.<br /><br>Rather than go on and on about my experience of Hertz's \"bait and switch\" at the rental desk and how American Express failed to \"act as my (their client) representative repeatedly - let me say that I DID GET THE REFUND OF THE AMOUNT HERTZ OVERCHARGED ME! A travel organization (not involved in this rental transaction at all) assisted me in getting Hertz to make the refund to my American Express Account.<br /><br>The morale of my experience - <br /><br>DON'T TRUST OR EXPECT AMERICAN EXPRESS TO ACT ON YOUR BEHALF OR AS YOUR ADVOCATE AND BEWARE AT THE HERTZ RENTAL COUNTER OF UP-CHARGES!!!!!</p>",

No.D-27433536 has lots of supporting documentation to show the double charge by the merchant. American express did not even look into the uploaded documents to come to a conclusion. American Express is so much biased toward the merchant, I reopened the dispute. It is asking me to upload any supporting documentation, I uploaded a couple of documents. American express's behavior is such non-sensical, it kept all the newly uploaded documents into the previously uploaded documents section. The dispute again says it is awaiting my response. <br /><br /><br>American Express is not committed to protecting small consumers like my company.<br /><br /><br>A 5th grader can understand the documentation and the charge in question, I am thinking American express intentionally does not align with the truth. American Express is afraid that it loses the commission if they undo the charges.<br /><br /><br>How low can you go?<br /><br /><br>I pledge not to use American express cards anymore from now on.<br /><br /><br>Thank you for being an unethical company.</p>",

        "content": "<p>When you have over the minimum 700 credit score, make 6 figures a year and carry a less than 30% debt to income ratio. I'd expect to get a card similar to the other 2 cards I possess with decent size limits. Keep in mind the other 2 cards have near a 0 balance and are Visa... A card I can use anywhere, Amex is useless in most daily life. But this company gave a whopping $1,000 limit. lol I carry more in cash than that. So I owned the card and account for all of 3 minutes. It's canceled and a waste of time. I travel weekly and was going for a Hilton card to get even more points. I rarely get a weekly hotel charge under $1,000 so this card is useless. I tried to get the limit increased but don't qualify.... What exactly does this limited use company want to see to get a normal limit. A $1,000 is what you give a kid just building credit.</p>",

I log in into my account and i come to find out that i got hit with the $695 annual fee, not even yet reaching my first month with the card. Credit karma did not emphasize or provided any information that this would happen. I even called their agents directly so they could provide me all information in regards to this card before even applying for it . In that call with their agent he never once mentioned that the annual fee will get charged as soon as i receive the card. Once i provided all this information to their customer service team, their answer was \u201csorry sir there is nothing we can do\u201d they said i should have read the terms and agreements and they did not provide any solution, just basically saying tough luck, and continue with my day. Im extremely disappointed since i have not even reached a full month with the card and now i gotta find a way to cover a annual fee of that high amount. Really bad first impression for a new customer, i truly expected a more helpful solution, like what chase or other banks have provided for me.</p>",

This was a 9800 payment from a HELOC (home equity line of credit) that I took out where they sent the check to pay off my balance. I paid another Amex credit card off at the same time that went 15000+ check and another with a 10000 check. All of those worked fine as well. Also Amex put a hold on my account so none of funds are available. They say I need to verify the 9800 payment which I can't do because this was paid by a mailed in check from not my bank. I have a -5000 balance and a 10,000 limit yet they won't let me use any of balance. Very frustrating!</p>",

Amex does have offers that card holders can add to their card to earn additional rewards/cash back but some of the stores are not the ones I shop at or close by. Hopefully they'll add more department stores in the near future.</p>",

Since I've had my Amex card I've been using it a lot on my grocery shopping, subscription services which I do earn 6% cash back, gas prices have been up the roof but 3% cash back does help a bit because with all these high prices lately why not use a card that is helping you earn something back. My Amex is mostly my go to card even though I do have some other cards they don't earn as much as my Amex BCP. But then again with my Amex I'm only able to redeem for statement credits and my other cards I'm able to redeem it for statement credit, cash back, use it to pay purchases, redeem for gift cards, and so on. Also my Amex has no annual fee for the 1st year and then after the 1st year the annual fee will be $95.00, which isn't too bad if you're spending a good amount monthly/yearly.</p>",

With all the travel bans, chancy airline service, vax mandates, sickness, jobs loss, and general uncertainty.  It says my chances are excellent if I were to apply but the biggest thing is once they check they're not going to give me any credit.  If you get approved the next step, done at activation, is an IRS 4506 release of tax records.  This is done by Equifax.  I guess if you don't release your tax records to Equifax on behalf of Amex you can lose your other cards.</p>",

They also informed me they waived a interest charge for me that i never requested within that year and since i got that courtesy i couldn't get it again (i never asked for an interest fee waived and didn't know that existed, but could be a good perk). Double wammy hit. Wth happened to your customer service amx? Had no problems for one 5 years, not until the worst time possible! I would cancel you only if it didn't have adverse effects on my credit reporting atm in my life. Further, i made payment for amount due in full immediately after noticing the error because i don't want to deal with you anymore. That was over $6k in a single payment. Grrr!!!</p>",

Since then the spending limit has been much more flexible and not a hard credit line. I would highly recommend this card to business professionals!</p>",

KFC refunded the money but American Express never put the $40 back on to my card.  They then sent me an email saying that my account was overdrafted $7..  I didn't pay much attention to this email just assuming that the $40 would go back onto my card and the $7 would be refunded to American Express.  It was December 13th 2021 I was checking my account to see if my child tax credit head came through yet. I had planned to use this to finish the rest of my shopping for Christmas for I have six children.  Much to my surprise when I called it said my account had been canceled so I called to speak to somebody I spoke to two different ladies who told me that they check would be returned to the government and then mailed back to me.  So basically I was screwed for Christmas and if I wanted to challenge this situation I would have to write a letter in ink and mail it to them.  I can truly say I have never been so devastated or disgusted in my entire existence.  I will never ever use Jackson Hewitt again for taxes as long as they are with American Express.</p>",

Well american express freaked out and decrease the amount when the credit hot the account.  So I call to see why and they told me they didn't expect ne to use the money that early on. ? because of the low amount I don't really use it because it decrease my credit score because I'm to Cole to max amount.  I asked for an increase and they denied me because I use to little.  So I witch is it. I use to much so you decrease now I use to little So No Increase.  Make up your mind American express. You can't nit pic at every one because your scared of loss. Not every high purchase is a red flag. Especially if the have the funds to pay it off over time.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Today I received my new AMEX Business Card, and already I am disappointed.  I find their marketing to be at least disingenuous, and at most, outright deceptive.  I am a highly qualified applicant with a FICO score of 830 and decades of credit history without a single missed payment or ever having even approached my credit limits.  I applied for the card because of the 120,000pt introductory offer given that I have a large purchase I have to make in January that would immediately meet the minimum purchase requirement.  AMEX claims to have \"No Preset Spending Limit\", however, when I called the company to confirm receipt of my new card, I was told that my spending limit was only $10,000!!  They said that this was because I am new.  Therefore, only a portion of my intended purchase can go on this card, and I would need to wait to spend the additional $5,000 in subsequent months to meet the spending requirement.  So they are intentionally limiting my purchasing power &amp; making it more difficult for me to meet the spending requirement.  When I pointed out to them that I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card with a $65,000 credit line they didn't care, despite easily being able to confirm this through the credit check they themselves performed.  They assured me my spending limit would increase (despite there officially being a \"no preset spending limit\") as I used and paid off the card.  So an AMEX Bait and Switch.  I will wire the funds to my card to fund the purchase, collect the points, then cancel the card after the first year.  I strongly recommend anyone looking for a business card to get the Chase Ink Business Preferred Card, as well as a Chase Sapphire Reserve card in their own name.  Points can be transferred from the business card to the personal card, and the Chase Sapphire Reserve has amazing perks.  They instantly credit $300 in travel expenses - ANY TRAVEL EXPENSES - once they are incurred.  Not $200 in \"incidental\" airline charges like AMEX offers.  They also have deals where they offer 50% bonus points on Apple purchases.  I used my points for (2) new MacBook Air laptops, an I-phone 12, and a mix of accessories.  AMEX's perks are for Indeed?  Adobe?  Seriously???  Go with Chase, I promise you it's a far more REWARDING experience.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Just signed up for the American Express Delta Blue card a few months ago.  At first it was great, and I used it for everything. <br /><br /><br>I Spent the last 3-5 years fixing my credit after medical and other hardships forced me into a tough spot. But I did it! Got my score up to a 780! I had plans to purchase a house and finally get my life back on track. <br /><br>So I received my card around the beginning of October and planned a trip and booked my flight. I spent over a $1000 but made a $1000 payment right away. I ended up purchasing other items and whatnot for the trip along with daily necessities. I had over $1000 on the card again.  So around November 6th (three weeks before my first bill was even due, and days before I received it in the mail) I made another $950 payment leaving about $100 left unpaid on the card. I wanted my card balance low in case I wanted to use it while on Vacation. <br /><br /><br>Come to find out a day or two later that my credit score took a 100 point hit because American Express felt the need to report my high Balance on November 1st to the credit bureau 4 weeks before my bill was even due. I didn't miss a payment and actually made a $1000 payment before they felt the need to report my balance.  <br /><br>Now my credit score is ruined, at least for the purpose of purchasing a house at a low mortgage rate. <br /><br /><br>I called and asked them if this was common practice for them. Reporting a customer to the bureaus for high credit limit before you give the customers a chance to even get their first bill in the mail, yet alone giving them a chance to pay before the due date, and after they already made payments in good faith weeks before the bill was even due. They basically said yes. They acknowledged my current low balance and said they would report it immediately to the bureaus. But that was all they could do.<br /><br>So now I will never use this card again. It will sit on my credit and just be an open account. Good job AMEX, ruining a brand-new customers life after he spent years trying to fix it.</p>",

All my other cards (VISA/Mastercard) only slashed my limit and never looked back.

For example: I was making a large purchase and I asked for an increase on my credit card. It was raised to $ 20,000.00 and was asked if that was enough. That is what I call excellent service. They were the only credit card that opened a credit card for me after my divorce and I have never forgotten their wonderful understanding at the lowest time of my life. I have always paid off the full amount of my purchases every month and it shows because my credit score is above 800. Keep up the good work!!</p>",

What caught my attention was an offer for $300 to sign up.  All I would have to do to get it would be the usual \u201cspend this amount of money within this amount of time\u201d.  Well I did everything required and guess what!?  No $300 ever came my way.  I spoke with 4 supervisors at this point and they will not budge.  All claim that a screen supposedly popped up when I signed up telling me that I wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the promotion.  I swear on my mother\u2019s life, there was no such screen.  Trust me, I always keep an eye out for things like that when signing up too.  NO WAY!!!!!!  THERE WAS NO SUCH SCREEN!!!!  They are weaseling their way out!  And what would it mean even if they had put up a screen!?  Why would someone be eligible for a card but not the promotion!???  What kind of scam is that!?????  Save yourself the trouble and trust me on this one.  Do not sign up with them.  You will regret it!  The customer service is not good.  The promotions are a SCAM!!!!!

Just like most credit card or any corporation, they tend to be remote and impersonal and I despise being routed to different agents 5 times in a row and never accomplish the task at hand such as to question a unauthorized or duplicate charges which can occur with vendors (as I have a business account with them). Not to mention how many times the damn phone calls dropped because they routed me somewhere across the globe in Asia or Europe.  But without any warning, I received a letter that the account is cut off and they no longer wanted me as a customer.  However, the cancellation letter did not contain the person who wrote and issued the letter and therefore no personal accountability at all.  I can't even know if that was based on a personal vendetta of one of the agents.  Not only that I was brushed off like dirt after 10 years with this company, my over 280,000 award points were also cancelled by their company's executive office.  This act is extremely unprofessional and unethical.  To me, that is corporation thievery at its finest to a small guy like me!  I have been a champion for American Express for so long as my business have been accepting American Express cards all these years, unlike many other businesses that don't.  This experience got me rethink my strategy and my blind devotion to them while they couldn't care one bit simply because I am a no body after all to these faceless, nameless overlords.</p>",

If you can't comprehend or understand that logic, and put feelings or party lines over real world realities, I pray for you.<br /><br>Two: Creating this much hate and division is a work place is extremely counter productive to both employee output, and business performance. This is incredibly damaging to people's mental health and service abilities to customers. <br /><br>Consequences: I'm canceling both my person American Express credit card, and my 7 business AMEX cards tomorrow morning. <br /><br>Maybe you should think twice before hiring \"consultants\" who are probably anti-American socialists to run your for-profit business for you. Luckily Capitalism is baked into the DNA of this still Free country, and you have a good dozen or so competitors who will gladly take my business.

The customer even had the Manufacturer come to their home for inspection and it was approved by them as an above standard installation. The customer claimed breach of contract and denied the charge. I supplied all documentation to American Express that the job was installed as written on the contract, inspected and approved by Fire Department and they denied my request and charged me back for the job over $5,000. with no recourse. Just DENIED! They did not tell me what was the breach or how to correct no information, just DENIED! All because the customer said so!

        "content": "<p>Going through a very bad experience currently with Amex. My business was approved for a business gold card with no preset spending limit. We've been utilizing it for our purchasing and then paying it off each statement period. My partner normally does the purchasing and since he's not the primary signer, Amex put a hold on the account until they can verify my personal taxes? I understand that this is a small business account and it requires a guarantor, but the business income should be taken into consideration. The business will have a lot more spending power than an individual due to its cash flow, and Amex only wants to take into consideration personal tax returns. Which should be a factor to understand that the guarantor has some sort of income, but not the only determining one when there's a business with 100x the personal income. It seems the whole customer service team is overseas and it was honestly a bit challenging to understand these employees. Why not ask for this in the beginning? Now, while they verify the income we have to move all of our purchases over to the previous card. Unnecessary inconvenience. I'm really not happy with this.</p>",

They now have caused a more than 100 point drop on my report. <br /><br>After contacting the AmEx credit bureau department, as well as the 3rd party collection agency (all day being sent back and forth with no help or answers, except that, \"you need to pay the balance off\") the 3rd party rep actually had to audacity to say to me, \"once you pay this debt you can re-establish a relationship with AmEx as you are a valued customer\".

Getting gas for a dollar off per gallon definitely helps with fuel costs at Kroger Gas Stations plus they have Shell and BP gas station gift cards when away on trips. The 6% cash rewards is simply the best I have found. Even with the $95 annual fee, l have not found another card that can beat this card.

I called to check why it was declined, they advised me to split the payment into 2. I did that and it was declined again. I called them again and explained that if the charge doesn't go through I will incur fees since it's a long weekend. They said to try it again. Tried, declined. Called again and spoke with Peggy. She gave me some attitude, which I did not deserve, I did not yell, spoke respectfully. I am their client for about 12 years but no more. I am closing all my accounts with AMEX, business(es), and personal, and I advise you to do the same. If they are not there the 1 time in 5 years that I need them then what's the point.</p>",

I have Never missed a pmt, always either over pay or pay it off.  Also, they WILL sell your personal information and you will get hounded by email to buy this and buy that with the card.  My truly honest advice is visa, Mastercard, discover.  They have treated me extremely well.  I hope this helps anyone considering this card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Service has deteriorated in the last few years, it appears I am now paying just to be lied to and put on hold... I called AMEX today to confirm my flights in August to Europe and ask about covid precautions. I was told that the airport, date and duration of my return flight had changed but no one had informed me. My return flight went from a duration of 13hrs to 38hrs and I was then told I would have to pay if I wanted a better flight or fly from my original selection. I was also told I would have to pay for a bus to the new departure location. I refused to agree to this as none of this was my fault nor was I informed and I was then transferred to the Platinum insurance dept as my card covers travel interruptions like this. An automated service said there would be a 5min wait and I was on hold for 35mins and then the phone was hung up on. When I called AMEX Travel back I was told this department closed at 6:30pmEST, while I was on hold, I asked to speak with a supervisor who then told me the dept isn't even open on the weekends. At the same time I was on the Online Chat service and I was told the Ins Dept was open until 8pm and was given a direct number to call that didn't work. I asked the supervisor I was speaking to on the phone to send me information to make a formal complaint as I was receiving 3 different stories form 3 different AMEX staff members and I was told there was no further person to contact and there was nothing more I could do. This is terrible service but its worse when this all in response to AMEX changing my flights without notifying me and asking me to pay for any extra cost they caused, I spent 3 hours on the phone today to be told there is no one working that could help me and I have to call the insurance dept on Monday. I just want Amex to honor their service agreement and instead I pay hundreds of dollars to have my flights changed and then treated like this by the service team.</p>",

Up until last month I have been pleased with the service provided. Now I have an issue. My wife and I planned a cruise last year before COVID hit. Our cruise was canceled so we rebooked for this year and booked our airline tickets to Europe also. Our cruise was canceled again this year so we decided to ask for a refund for both the cruise and the airline fare until COVID sorts itself out. We received the cruise credit within two weeks...no issues. Our airline was non-US carrier and a bit of a challenge to even ask for the refund. Finally, I was able to piece together the refund and explain to AE how to proceed. Several weeks ago I received a credit for the airfare ($6,500) and then was immediately rebilled the same amount. I have had numerous discussions with the Conflict Resolution department, but seem to receive a different story every time I call. I even had a supervisor hang up on me even though I was calm through out the call. I have had to dispute charges in the past and never had this issue. It seems as if the Conflict Resolution team is not on the same sheet of music.</p>",

I reached out to the customer service and they said there was no transactions ever sent over and they didn\u2019t lock my card for travel notice or anything and claimed that the merchants\u2019 terminals issues. How can this be a terminals issue when I sent to 5 different stores and decline at all of the purchases? After the call, it works again! Also, I was declined for my Bonus Offer. No one can provide me exact reason through chat and phone call! They just said I agree to that I accept there will be no bonus offer. I asked for proof of that when I agreed, but they told me they don\u2019t keep all of that for my security reason! Sure! Sounds like cheating to me!</p>",

As punishment for trying to purchase a cup of coffee, I had to spend over an hour on the phone dealing with people who seemed to think I had stolen my identity, and were very difficult to work with. I will not recommend this card to anyone in the future, and am incredibly unlikely to renew the card for a second year. I expected FAR better service for a card with a comparatively large annual fee. Instead, I got poor service, and treated like I was an identity thief. <br /><br>Save yourself some trouble and go with a better card.</p>",

My existing account login failed.  I know my ID and password are correct but I try to reset the password anyway to just move ahead.  The website tells me the system is down and can't reset my password.   Which one is it?   Bad credentials or a crashed service?   I call into the CS number on the back of the card and ask that question.   I get someone who wants to verify my card but doesn't know where the various numbers are on the card (card number is NOT on the front of the card), argues with me, and wants to reset my password.   \"There's nothing wrong, these things just happen, I can't explain it, you just need to reset your password.\"   I explain that resetting my password will only be an exercise in frustration if the system is down and ask again to check if there are system issues.  I get more arguing and more insistence on resetting my password.  I ask for a supervisor.  15 minutes later I'm told there are no supervisors and they'll call me back within 24 hours.  I assure the CSR that I can wait on the phone.    Another 15 minutes later I get a supervisor who also wants to argue and reset my password.   I eventually get her to actually listen and she realizes they have a technical issue, asks for a screenshot, and opens a ticket for the problem.   <br /><br /><br>It shouldn't have taken over an hour to convince someone to look to see if there was an issue, I shouldn't have needed to escalate to a supervisor, and resetting my password without resolving the issue would have added to the frustration.  <br /><br /><br>For a financial organization that likes to promote itself as a premium brand, this was a dismal performance for a function that happens thousands of times a week.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I spent a couple of years staring at this card and questioning the annual fee versus my ability to enjoy the benefits. This year, I finally took the risk and I\u2019m so happy I did it. <br /><br /><br>I started small, just enjoying a weekend on the beach at a nice Hilton property with my wife. The Hilton Honors Gold status made a lot of difference. I was off for a good start. <br /><br /><br>A couple of months later, I planned a three day weekend to Las Vegas. I was aiming for the Fine Hotels and Resorts benefit. Oh, boy, we enjoyed amazing experiences, thanks to my Amex Platinum. The VIP lounges at the airports, the great rates at 5 star hotels (planned in advance), the early check in and late check out, the complimentary meals at great restaurants, all together added great, unimaginable value to our trip. It really felt like a luxury trip.<br /><br /><br>I believe the biggest misconception about this card is that \u201cyou have to travel a lot to make it worth it\u201d, which a totally disagree. First, you can easily recover the annual fee just by taking advantage of the offers and benefits in form of credits: but yes, you have to enjoy collecting small prizes here and there. Second, if you just go into a couple of weekend getaways and maybe a bigger trip each year, you\u2019ll get tremendous value out of this card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I would have thought a Platinum Cardholder would get better service. I called to make a change to a hotel reservation, and did not think the whole process would be so complicated. The first person I talked to was nice, but hard to understand. They were able to competently make the change I wanted, but they told me that I could not use points with the update. They told me I would have to go to their redemption service center to get the points retroactively applied to the account. I thought this was strange, however I just went with it. Before transferring me they gave me a number to call in case I was disconnected, which I appreciated, but more to come on that later. Once transferred, the person could not help me. They ended up talking to me at length about what they could do, but then eventually said they were going to transfer me to someone else. After coming off another long hold, they told me that they explained the situation in detail to this next person and that now I would be transferred. However, instead of being connected with someone, it simply ended the call... This was after an hour total of talking with people and being on and off hold. I just wanted to make a simple hotel booking change. I called the number they left me with to call back if disconnected, and it took me to some scammy-sounding number that wanted to offer me a $100 statement credit, but could not even confirm that they were with AmEx. When I asked them to provide some sort of confirmation, they just said have a good day and hung up. Definitely very unsatisfied with how things went down. This means I will have to call back again in a few days when I find the time just to fight to use my points for a simple transaction. Either that or cancel this trip altogether out of frustration.</p>",

I own my house outright, and haven't had a car loan, mortgage, or anything else for years. I monitor my credit very closely, here and on other sites, and noticed that not having any installment loan history was pulling my score down (very slightly). <br /><br /><br>This loan did not involve a hard pull or anything (it was pre-approved, as I already have credit cards with Amex), and its interest rate (low single digits) was lower than the cards I paid off with it. <br /><br /><br>Although I took it out as a 36-month loan, I knew from the get-go that I'd pay it off in about a year, so the fees associated were really reasonable. I set up auto-pay through my checking account, and watched the balance dwindle. <br /><br /><br>I have nothing but good things to say about this! It was painless, there were no hidden fees or anything shady, no penalty for paying it off early, etc. I highly recommend it.</p>",

They do have very good customer service, even if it is not based stateside and they do try to sell you on upgrading to one of their fancier cards with an annual fee every time you call.  But, they definitely do take care of you and that is what counts!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Former American Express business credit cardholder.  Really really bad... that's all I can say.  I tried to leave a lengthy and detailed review, with lots of facts, for you all, but the site refuses to submit it.  Key points:  1) AMEX does not back you when a shady vendor mischarges you and you can prove it (In writing).  2) your credit limits will be reduced to unpractical levels, hampering your business, if your balances get too high for their liking, then require you to produce financials until they will even consider reviewing your account to place the limits back to their original dollar amount.  This happens even if you pay off all the balances.  3) AMEX will call you on Christmas Eve to give you all the bad news and nothing good.  4) Reward benefits are shrinking quickly and constantly screwed up 5) Interest rates are through the roof 6) Grace periods between charges and payments due is only about three weeks (Many companies are 45 days to as much as 90) 7) Customer service, or should I say lack thereof, I'd rate a 2 out of 10.  I dealt with, at least, five different reps to handle three different issues, in less than 9 months of time, the most issues I've had on credit cards in 20 years (I have 12 currently and own three businesses).  <br /><br /><br>These people are Time Thieves, if you can weather the hour-long phone loops of automated BS, you're sure to get an overworked, overwhelmed, underwhelming individual to \"help\" you.  Do yourself a favor, go get a credit card from a credit union!</p>",

I was still a few thousand away from my limit and have never once missed a payment. Also, I had over 20,000 reward points on my card. When I called to connect my card to Apple Pay the customer service rep convinced me to transfer to a cashback card. He said it would transfer over in 24 hours. He did not mention that I would lose all my points I had acquired with the previous card. Such a dirty trick. I called customer service again and he said he would get back to me, but said if it was in writing I would lose any previous rewards, then there was probably nothing he could do. He told me he would get back to me either way in a few days. He never called back.</p>",

Ironically, when Amex do post them, they postdate them back to the merchant's actual date of at least a week prior yet Amex did not make the funds available at that time. They do not list the refunds - they don't even show pending. The refunds just appear. Not only are these major inconveniences because you think the merchants have not sent the refunds, but the delayed postings make monitoring your account even more difficult. <br /><br /><br>Also, I have not received a credit limit increase ever in the 10+ years that I have had the account despite perfect payment history, regular usage and zero monthly balance with monthly payoff. Twice a year, I let a balance post so they earn some interest off of me.</p>",

I don't like working with companies that don't have the best interest of the customer at heart. I use this card a lot. I was expecting to have thousands of reward points at my disposal and instead, I have none. <br /><br>I've decided to stop using this credit card for purchases since it's obvious that your customers are treated poorly and your representatives show little to no concern for the satisfaction of your card members. I complained about all of this to him and he just said, \"sorry, there's nothing we can do\". No attempt to make it better. No attempt to work with me to keep me happy. No attempt to compromise. <br /><br>I know that my business will not be missed but I can only hope that others will notice the callousness of the Amex reps and will opt out of working with your company as well.</p>",

The annual fee is a little high but the first year I got a TSA credit (it is so nice not to have to wait in line!) and a lot of baggage checked for free so it MORE than made up for the $250. I also like the access to the Delta airport lounges.<br />In two more months I will receive a companion certificate from Amex. So after I used my Bank of America Royal Caribbean Visa Signature card to purchase a cruise, I will use this card for the airfare. I will buy one roundtrip ticket for me and my husband gets a FREE roundtrip. When I use my BofA cruise reward credits on this cruise for onboard purchases like alcohol and shore excursions, this trip will be super cheap! I am getting very good at working the rewards card system. LOL.<br />I got this card with a credit rating of around 680ish. AmEx does a hard inquiry via Experian. I would recommend seeing if you can prequalify on AMEX website. They do a soft inquiry only. If they offer you the card, and you agree to TOS, they then will do a hard pull. FWIW, Wallethub said I had a \"fair\" chance of acceptance.<br /> Credit line was initially very low at $1750 but it has tripled over the year due to my CS in the very good range now. The customer service, like Discover, is personal and outstanding.</p>",

I've had the card now for just under 3 years with a current credit line of more than $18,000. I've paid in full about half the time I've had the card. Otherwise, I've made sure to pay about 50% or more of my balance. The cash back rewards add up and are very simple to redeem for statement credit. Very happy to have this bad boy in my wallet!</p>",

Forget it. Will they expedite your card to you? Forget it! You have to wait more than a week to get it in the mail. is it for your identity protection? That's complete BS because I'm willing to give them any other information they need. They just don't want to spend the money to expedite it and they don't want to give me a reason why. One might even suspect that they are hoping not to have to pay the initial sign on bonus if I'm not able to make the minimum number of purchases in 6 months.</p>",

I added one offer of 24S SPEND $500 GET $100 BACK to my card. And I made purchase on Nov 27. The offer expired at around Nov 30. I did not receive the cash back and connect to representative on Dec 07. They checked the purchase date and amount. They asked me whether i could see the offer in my account. I said i could see it until Dec 02 and it has disappeared because it is expired. After that, they told me that they could check the expired offer at their end and can't see it. They said I never added the offer to my card. That's impossible because i checked it everyday from the day before i purchase to Dec 07. I checked it everyday, and talk to my boyfriend. He also saw it is in my account. That's the fact! I could not accept this reason that i never added it to my account. They distorted the fact! How about i have the screenshot of the offer in my account? Will they insist that i never added it? That means i should take a screenshot after every purchase to verify my purchase? The worst experience and maybe i will cancel my card with it.</p>",

I called American Express for help since there was not a hospital on the island. The American American Express office was amazing. They told me to get to the airport and if there were no flights in the next few minutes they would send medical team by jet. By chance there was a small plane leaving within a few minutes. We literally jumped on the floor. Meanwhile, my child was in very bad shape and could not speak. Upon arrival in Miami, an ambulance appeared and customs agents to keep moving and get to the hospital. American Express talked me through everything and were nice beyond description. When we arrived at the hospital , the doors open and it was amazing. There were more than two drs and nurses. My daughter lived which was wonderful. Our dr said my daughter would have passed within half and hour without medical attention. American Express was incredibly amazing saving my daughter\u2019s life</p>",

This year I have paid a late fee almost every month. I have set up my account to notify me in advance of the bill being due because I went paperless and yet I do not get notified. I have been charged $400 over the last 11 months in late fees. These are the first late fees I've paid to a credit card company in my 50 years. Every payment was made on the day it was due or 2 days later and yet I was told that they could not take it off. I'm done doing business with them. They are unethical and have their service agents lying to customers. Welcome to the next evolution of American Express!</p>",

There are several banks that do a better job and will pay credits the month of INSTEAD of the month late that amex does.   I also never received my sign up bonus despite several calls.</p>",

I understand they have so much cards to memorize and so many offers and things to remember but if you\u2019re not ready to give accurate knowledge then you should say excuse me for a min let me confirm that. But no you go on and give false information and then when they fuck up they say we are sorry. Well yeah damn right you are but at least make it right!!! Fix what you did!  But no, they are too big now to care at all about fixing a mistake they did!</p>",

FWIW, I waited til 91st day after receiving platinum card to request 3x credit line increase. It worked. So I'll wait 90 days and then request 30k limit on this card. Thanks to others on this website, I've gained valuable insight. And to think less than 2 years ago my CS was in low 500s. <br /><br /><br>Pay off any collections, keep utilization below 10% if you can. If you cannot, pay card off as soon as you can so you'll rebound ASAP. Good luck!</p>",

My FICO score was lower when I got the card and over the time of two years it has gone way up and they refused to still increase my credit line.  I've made many purchases and paid in full always on time.   I went to Discover and they gave me a credit line of 10,000 after I closed my American express account..  I fell out of my chair.

        "content": "<p>Everything about American Express is disgraceful. I signed up for a Cash Magnet card under a promo offer for 0% interest for 15 months, $200 bonus for a minimum spend, and 1.5% cash back on purchases. I was approved for the card, had been using the card to purchase material for a project and then a month in received an interest charge of $150 even though I paid the minimum payment and it was supposed to be 0% interest for 15 months. I also was not receiving any cash back or other bonuses. I called Amex to figure out what was going on and they told me, I wasn't eligible for the promotional offers. When I asked why, they couldn't tell except for someone in the \"specialty department\" decided they removed those options for me. I had an option between this Cash Magnet card and 3 others from different creditors and ultimately decided on this card because it had the best offer. Only to find out, they removed the sign-up offers from my account without ever notifying me! They wouldn\u2019t put any of this writing of why I did not get the offer bonus after being approved and wouldn\u2019t look up or share any notes or transactions on my account. Complete abuse of power, fraud, and disgraceful business. I ended up paying off the $15k balance to a $0 after they refused to do anything for me and then they charged me an additional $105 of interest chargers AFTER my balance was $0. I will never use Amex again because of this complete fraud and intend on taking additional action to report this.</p>",

I used American Express because I was under the impression that they backed me and my purchases.  The $100 is more important to them than my business.

A stroll through HELL with Amex.  It's this kind of idiotic  Amex customer service why I gradually started using other credit cards in the first place.  I see nothing has changed and and it has only reinforced my decision to drop them completely.   Don't understand how they stay in business.</p>",

Today I tried to make a $5k purchase and my card was declined. I call them to see if it was something I needed authorize and was told that my credit limit has been decreased from $33k to $1,500. Yes, you read that right; they took away $31,500 of credit line. They told me because I don't spend the full limit of my card, they reduced it to what I actually use. The only way to potentially increase my limit again was to send them bank statements, pay stubs, and tax returns. Just because I don't use the full amount regularly doesn't mean I won't need it at some point, but apparently they don't care. I am extremely disappointed with how American Express handled this matter and I will be taking my business elsewhere. It's absolutely astonishing the lack of customer service and loyalty they have to their members.</p>",

I called costumer service on Sep. 10th because the hotel has money on hold even though I paid the full amount. Costumer representative told me \"you have to call them, you stayed at the hotel not us\" ?? I was chocked of the way he was talking to me. I called again to speak to a supervisor to file a complaint but the representative said she won't be able to take my call and she will call me next day morning. Next morning no call still, 11 am.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Best &amp; Most Generous CC Issuer! <br /><br /><br>AMEX gave me a chance when others wouldn't, customer service (when needed) is the best. Have been a member of the AMEX family for two years as of the date of this review (my 2nd time), wished I had never left the 1st time. <br /><br /><br>At any rate, AMEX is a great group, or has been to me. Gave me an initial CL of $2,000, discovered a 'secret' that after 61 days, can ask for a 3x CLI (on the web page or phone) &amp; they'll give it with soft pull. I entered $6,000 and was asked my income, pressed Enter &amp; before could blink my eyes, had what was requested. <br /><br /><br>Another 6 months later, asked to be moved to $7,500, and got it. 6 more months, asked for $8,000 &amp; that's where I hit the wall, was given counter offer of $7,600, of which I took. So I presume the CL is relative to income, with that in mind, AMEX is generous to one who was making a little over $21,000 in retirement benefits (now just over $22,000). Some CC issuers wants to see more income, like $25,000-30,000 minimum. <br /><br /><br>I'll keep hitting the low button every time I get a raise, $100 is better than $0, all limits combined counts towards my overall utilization, which by chance is $8 out of a combined $12,100 limit. <br /><br /><br>Due to this, and account aging, discovered today my FICO (Experian) is 791, it's a perk of AMEX to display the monthly updated score. Not all CC issuers &amp; banks does this, although the number is growing. Very few gives a 3x CLI after just 61 days also, using only soft pulls, with the option to ask after that every 6 months, or if there's a major change, such as a high bump in income, to be grated sooner. Then will fall back into every 6 months. <br /><br /><br>I highly recommend AMEX to anyone, given my experience, I can only presume that those with negative ones have paid late (don't wait until the last minute, pay 3-5 days before due date, 10 days if mailed) and/or have had other issues with their customer experience specialists. They have been great to me in my credit rebuild, didn't have bad credit, just didn't use much fr over 11 years after becoming disabled. As a result, my scores dropped. AMEX opened the door to blow the hinges off of my previous high, around 712 around the year 2005. Member 4 Life!</p>",

I have a 737 FICO and yet they turned me down first by saying I was in credit counseling, they could not answer how I would have a 737 if this was true. I then sent in the documentation showing that was a fabrication, they then said I have lates, the only lates I had where on a student loan in 2014, 7 years ago and will be dropping off. Then they said my credit ratios were to high, I sent in proof that all my other cards were paid off, then they said my loan balances were to high so I sent in proof all my car loans and finance loans were $0. Please just admit you have not idea on what you are doing which is why so many places no longer accept AMEX.<br /><br /><br>In the same time frame all this we happening I got approved by Bank of America for an Allegiant with a $6000 limit and CITI approved me for a platinum with a $15,000 limit. The only reason I wanted the AMEX at all was I was applying for the Hilton Honors to build points. I told my wife we will build the points the fun way by staying at a Hilton using the cards that do not have idiots working for them.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I closed my card and was informed I have $0 owed. A year and a half later I while attempting to purchase my family a home I am informed that my credit just dropped 85 points due to collections filed by AMEX. I called, immediately paid my full balance and they apologized for the mistake and removed 6 months worth of late fee charges and told me they would be able to fix the problem by a method called \"Re-aging\". I was told this by several employees as I was bounced around the call board. I finally requested both customer service and credit get on the line together to end this ping pong match and was informed \"they are unwilling to re-age my account\" which would remove my negative mark from their mistake from December 2019 through July 2020. I informed them that I never received a single statement, email, phone call or collection notice. They used the loophole that \"no mail was ever returned to us\" to get out of re-aging my account, essentially leaving my credit 85 points in the hole and my family with no home after our house sale finalizes. I requested a fax stating that my account was paid off so I could submit a dispute and they eagerly agreed. I called back several days later to discover that there is a note on my account to \"not send the statement because my account is in collections\" even though I paid it in full, and they actually owe ME a credit back. They have acknowledged that my account is completely paid off several times but that they simply will not provide a statement. I'm currently on hold again, this makes roughly 10 hours in the last 2 weeks by the way, waiting to a supervisor to explain to me why they are unable to do anything at all. Reading through these reviews, it seems I'm not the only person that has experienced this issue. I've never experienced this kind of situation in my life with any company. It's appalling that such a \"reputable\" company would be so unable to fix a problem they caused and that they went to any loophole possible to avoid actually doing anything to fix their mess. I hope these guys get their act together or someone sues the living hell out of them for ruining somebodies' life.</p>",

Save your self the stress and anguish and never open an account with them you will regret it just like me. This company should be shut down and embarrassed with how they operate. Horrible customer service and they will try to keep making you pay them when you have completely paid off your balance. They truly should be ashamed of themselves. I\u2019m so disturbed I could vomit.</p>",

I highly recommend the Blue Cash Preferred card to those with excellent credit who feed a family and use a fair amount of gasoline. My sign up bonus was a $300 credit.

Factor in the extended warranty feature and a whole bunch of other usable features, and this card is pretty hard to resist. Check it out.</p>",

Never a late payment and I\u2019ve never used more than 2k a month. I wanted to cancel immediately. I was charged the annual fee of $95 May 26th, so reasonably I should be reimbursed $79 as of July 14 given I only used a month and a half, but she said the max I could get was $71 because the bill hit in May. How ridiculous. When I called to cancel the card and have my membership fee reimbursed at a prorated rate they said no because it was more than 30 days!! Unbelievable. Punished for purchasing my first home. Thanks for nothing American Express!</p>",

On the other hand I handle my accounts responsibly. Never pay late. Never use too much available credit. But I think we all know that when you handle your accounts good you are treated good in return. I have 4 Amex cards and my favorite is the Blue Cash Preferred.</p>",

Times are tough right now, and I wasn't going to have enough to pay my monthly balance off, and I was therefore going to be charged a significant amount of money in interest. In order to avoid this, I arranged for a balance transfer to another credit card with a lower rate. Unfortunately, due to whatever reason, the balance transfer was going to arrive (most likely) a couple days after my monthly pay off date. I asked AMEX to give me an extension, or a grace period, or whatever, just to give time for the balance transfer to arrive, and THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING. THEY REFUSED TO HELP A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF 8 YEARS. And for that, I cancelled my AMEX card immediately. BEWARE--in a pinch? Don't count on AMEX to care!</p>",

It\u2019s more of a little game to try and get your absurd $550 annual fee back. It has become less impressive as of late. The lounges never seem to be open, or are at capacity. There are a lot of perks but you have to be eagle-eyed and basically OCD to earn them. If you fly a lot on one airline, it\u2019s helpful. Or if you want to buy everyone around you drinks on the plane, you can do that at the end of the cycle. Uber, streaming, these little perks do add up, but really you\u2019re paying for the best customer service. I usually end up earning around $400 back a year, so it\u2019s $150 a year for the original status symbol card and the absolute best credit card customer service, from anywhere in the world. It\u2019s justifiable to me but increasingly losing value, especially since we appear to be embracing telework. The perks aren\u2019t that exclusive any longer. Smart company, so I\u2019m hoping they make a big change soon or I will likely cancel.</p>",

DO NOT USE AMEX!!!<br /><br>Having been a Member since \"81, I am heartbroken after a regular auto pay monthly bill was declined to my Golf Club by Amex. I have 3 accounts with them. Green, Gold and Business Platinum, and I have NEVER had a LATE payment in 39 years. <br /><br>I was told that I asked for Covid-19 relief and that has impacted my credit worthiness and my limits were reduced because of this.<br /><br>I have regularly had balances on the Gold and Platinum cards of well over $20,000, and never had a declined charge.<br /><br>The fact of the matter is that I NEVER asked for Covid-relief? I don't even know what that is???<br /><br>Long and the short of it is that I spent 1 hour and 20 minutes on the phone with them, talked to 2 Reps and a supervisor and they refused to cover the charge for <br /><br>my club bill. It is obvious that Amex has moved there customer service out of the cou coun <br /><br>operations out of the country</p>",

I made all of my payments on time and always for as much more than the minimum due as I could afford each month and as a result they regularly in creased my credit limit up to its current $2,000 limit. With their trust and help I have watched my credit score climb from bad to good in less than 2 years. Thank you American Express!</p>",

        "content": "<p>BEWARE of American Express Covid 19 RELIEF!!!!  Since I deal in International business and everything shut down temoporarily due to quarantine, I was getting some relief with their deferred interest plan.  On one of the calls, the agent told me they have a new program of relief that you can enroll in that will cut the interest from 11% to 6%, and waves renewal fees while on plan, so no need to call monthly.  I can opt out anytime.  I specifically asked multiple times if this affects anything else benefits, and most importantly credit line.  They said NO. So I agreed.  The very next day they cut all credit lines to basically $100 over my balances.  Including taking away by credit on my business card which I was paying $595 per year.  As a consequence, all my autopays got cancelled and my credit rating went down since it shows i was completely extended.  And no open credit for new charges.  I immediately called and asked for a supervisor and they told me it takes 7-10 days.  It took them less than 24 hours to take everything away.  I FEEL I WAS TOTALLY MALICIOUSLY GUIDED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF!!!  instead of helping me they completely shut me down.  They know exactly what they are doing and their agents know this is an important fact.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!  I have been a loyal customer with 4 Amex cards for  almost 20 years.</p>",

But reading all of the reviews about them doing that to people makes me nervous, so I got myself a real \"grown up\" bank account to keep most of my money in.  That said, I do like this card.<br /><br /><br>+The things I like most about my Blue Bird card is that I can keep all my money in the set aside account and just put as much money as I want to spend in the main account. I like knowing that if anyone tried to use my card or charge a sneaking \"monthly fee\", they would get denied for insufficient funds right away.<br /><br /><br>+Another thing I like about the card is it is kind of like a secret stash. They do not report to the IRS or any other authority that I know of. <br /><br /><br>-Con... crappy customer service with people who talk so fast in such a strong accent that you can hardly understand them. I got conflicting information from different customer service reps about the same issue. And neither was correct! (The check cashing service somehow put an instant payment that was for more that the check was in my account. I was told by one person not to touch it, it wasn't my money, and that he was going to report it immediately. It was like he was mad at me for some reason. Another rep told me that there was nothing she could see regarding it nor do about it and to try calling the check cashing company. Well long story short, I researched up on it and if they put extra money in your account from a check, that it is their error and once the money is in your account it is yours. They just eat the difference.<br /><br /><br>-Another con is that I recently got another Blue Bird account (their site says you can have up to five) but it will not allow me to transfer funds from one account to the other because I am the same person. So what?!</p>",

I have paid off my balance with amex and will destroy the 2 cards i have with them plus my business credit card. I don't recommend this company at all.

The offer indicated that card information would be provided for the booking of the flight and there was a $200 statement credit with the first statement. I was approved within a few minutes, however all I received in the email from Amex was the last 5 digits of the card number with the disclosures. I called customer service which took a few minutes to get through and ask why I didn\u2019t get the card info needed to complete the booking. The rep was polite but hard to understand so obviously an offshore call center. She didn\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t receive the info the offer said I should get upon approval and kept telling me to \u201cupdate my email\u201d. As there was only one seat left in the flight so I paid with Discover and cancelled the account. Wasted an hour with this BS late at night. Oddly enough a rep answered after two rings when I stated \u201ccancel my account\u201d and she spoke very good english. So if you want to get right through to a rep tell that damn computer that answers your call \u201ccancel account\u201d.... it was a p!ss poor experience.</p>",

As a card member since 1986 with an excellent payment history, AMEX decided to cancel my account - JUST BECAUSE- is the answer I got from the agent when I contacted them. Just because AMEX decided to close some ZYNC accounts smack in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis when I most needed the card. I was very young in 1986 when I got the card. I am 65 now, a senior citizen and truly depended not this card and planned to use it to help me get through the COVID-19 crisis. My entire household is at risk and still in ;quarantine due to age and serious pre-existing medical conditions. AMEX gave no valid reason to close my card - JUST a WHIM - JUST BECAUSE they decided to close some ZYNC Accounts???? Really/ Did ou hear the part about me being a customer since 1986? And you are doing this now - of all times?  I guess they were not making enough money off ZYNC card customers as we still pay no annual fee and have smaller pre-set spending limits. Thank you Amercian Express for making a devastating challenging time in my life even worse. When other credit card issuers, lenders, banks and more are reaching out in compassion to help their customers, AMEX is taking the polar opposite approach. Shame on you!  Will never recommend you to anyone.</p>",

This gold delta card use to have the benefits of sky lounge but took that away. Kinda of a bummer</p>",

        "content": "<p>I wish I could give them negative 1,000,000 stars. This is the second worst credit card experience I have had since I canceled my Citi card like 8 years ago which was a nightmare. This company has even worse service than Citi. Here's my story:<br /><br /><br>My dad passed about a year ago and I needed to fly home for a while. On my way back, I was checking out Delta flights and there was a promotion, Amex card, buy x dollar amount before y time and you get a $200 statement credit and 60,000 miles. Was easy to hit the minimum with my flight home and a couple of purchases. I paid my first bill without seeing my statement because I couldn't get my card until I got back home. Once I had the card, I was trying to set up my online account but, for whatever reason, the online banking system wouldn't work. I paid my card over the phone again. By the third or fourth statement, I was fed up and called again to get my online account set up. They ask me a bunch of questions about the card and I finally get it straightened out, they set up my online banking. Cool, I see they never gave me my statement credit. I did get the miles.<br /><br /><br>Fast forward months go by and every time I go to log into my account, it's saying I have the wrong password, wrong card info, whatever and my account is blocked. I call and pay my bill and ask them to unlock my account. They make a one time password for me to get in, this happens 5 or 6 maybe even 8 times, I lost track.<br /><br /><br>Meanwhile, I call Delta to get my statement credit because Amex claims \"it's a Delta promotion, take it up with them.\" Delta claims, \"it's a statement credit,  take it up with Amex.\" This goes on for about 2 months, on the phone for hours each time, before I finally give up and decide I've spent more time trying to get the credit than it's worth.<br /><br /><br>Fast forward months again and still cannot log into my account. Every time I call them to get it fixed they are extremely rude, ask me for different information every single time, and this last time literally hung up on me when I complained why he's asking me for different information. One time it's this number, the next time it's this security question, the next time it's another number, it's never the same. It's honestly baffling and, as if they're messing with me. Literally, it feels like they're messing with my head. Every time it's a different question that I either answer and it's not right or I don't even know the answer to.<br /><br /><br>ALL I WANT TO DO IS LOG IN AND PAY MY BILL. I honest to god at this point think they're trying to prevent me from being able to pay it easily so I wrack up late fees. I can't come to any other conclusion as to why a company would make it this freaking hard to pay a damned bill.<br /><br /><br>I cannot WAIT to pay off my balance and close this card out and never have an American Express card again. This is a SLIMY SLIMY company with HORRIFIC customer service. Stay away for your own good.</p>",

When I call I continue to get different answers on when my money will be in my bank account. I've reached out to the IRS and they said if it's not there this week they will look into investigating.

People are unemployed due to Covid-19 and they are currently relying on using their credit cards to buy food and pay for stuff. How is this company going to justify closing these customers' accounts without any notice???!!!!! I will make sure that this is heard in every platform and will encourage my family and friends to close their accounts with American Express. This company does not deserve any business!! Instead of helping customers in this crisis, they find it ok to close people's accounts!!</p>",

        "content": "<p>I was a member with AMEX for 6 years and thought they were a great company. That all changed when all 7 of my cards were closed, most of them business cards for different business that I own. Last month I made all my payments in full as I do every month for all 7 cards and in error I forgot to update one of my business cards banking info. I made the payment but the payment was declined because of my error on not updating the banking info. I received an emailing letting me know there was an issue with my payment and it dawned on me that I forgot to update the new payment info. As I logged in to update the payment info, I noticed that my account had been closed. I thought that this must have been some type of error, so I called to make sure. As I was on hold, I started getting email after email about all my cards being closed! Once I got someone on the phone they told me that all the account were closed because of this one payment issue. Now keep in mind, that all the other payments were just fine for the other cards. The rep told me that I would need to pay off any remaining balance due and they could reinstate the cards, so I updated the payment info and paid the balance just as I planned on doing. After making the payment the rep told me that I would be charged a \"Reinstatement\" fee for all the cards that I was requesting to be reinstated WHAT??? pissed off and all, I decided to agree to their scam and pay the fee. AMEX was important to our businesses and I wanted to keep the relationship. After doing that, I was told that a decision would be mailed to me in 7-10 business days. Again, WHAT??? this is crazy! but what could I do? I wait the 7 business days to get letters in the mail saying they were not going to reinstate my accounts!! I had more reasons now on these letters that were sent to me. Some said because of the payment that was returned and others said my credit was not up to par.. The crazy part of that was that I had just applied for 2 new cards two weeks prior and was approved for them, so if my credit was an issue and a reason for them to close my accounts, why would they have just approved me for new cards?? In addition to that, I check my credit on a regular basis and it has not gone up or down, other than a few points over the past 6 years. Not only did AMERICAN EXPRESS close my accounts for a BS reason, I have over 200,000 points that they took also. To me this company is nothing more than a dirty company.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've been an American Express Online Savings customer for about two years, never having any problems until I got married... and my wife and I tried to open a joint account. Besides the computer problems (their website, including the application, kept bugging out and even once you do successfully have an account, the overall experience leaves much to be desired. Low-tech for 2020, and unacceptable for any AMEX card customers that have come to expect the same smooth portal and digital tools available to them on the credit card side... Online savings isn't on the same level.<br /><br /><br>Despite already having an individual savings account and adding my wife to my Amex Platinum Card, we were unable to open a joint account with AMEX savings, likely due to my wife's recent name change, or less likely AMEX thought her to be some kind of international super villain the likes of Carmen Sandiego, either way we received a letter in the mail asking for more documentation. I called, and the representative told me the only way they could proceed was if we waited 7-10 business days after mailing them more documentation. I brought up concerns that she doesn't have a utility bill in her name, and the representative offered mailing a bank statement with both our names &amp; the address... so I did. Two weeks later, I get another letter asking for more documentation, I call again and am told same thing, send another bank statement... two weeks later call again, am told it can't be a statement, has to be a letter signed by a bank officer (btw needing to retain the services of my local bank kinda defeats the argument for online banking in general). This representative was actually helpful, in reaching out to the banking division (while I'm on hold... despite numerous requests I was never actually allowed to speak to the team making the decisions) and then coming back on the line that a marriage certificate or drivers license would be accepted, and If I faxed it that day the account might be open by the end of the week. I faxed them both promptly.. then next week nothing, call again and am told they were not accepted and a letter would be mailed. I asked for a supervisor, which was unavailable so I would be called within 2 business days. It's day 3, I have yet to receive a call. <br /><br /><br>Resolution: My wife and I opened up a Marcus by Goldman Sachs online savings account... she just had to answer some additional verification questions over the phone with the representative. Their online platform is much better, and even allows wire transfers &amp; instant account linking to our local bank. I am in the process of closing my personal account I already held with AMEX online bank.</p>",

Since their cash back rewards is non-existent/low and I couldn't justify the additional fees, I decided to close the Optima for now to reduce my credit hit (I would've closed both). Unfortunately, AMEX doesn't really give you an easy way to \"transfer\" from one card to another. So I closed my Optima and opened a new AMEX Blue Cash Back. The $150 bonus (if you spend $2000 within 3 months) is nice but the rest of the offering is average. I think if this card had other/better cash back opportunities for day to day spending then that would make me give this card a higher grade (and more use). At the moment its just another card in my list.</p>",

        "content": "<p>My experience with American Express Delta Skymiles Platinum Card.<br /><br /><br>I hardly ever write reviews. I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time with American Express over the past 4 years, however, after the most recent conversations I have had with American Express representatives and realizing how they treat their customers, they have really left a bad taste in my mouth. I want this to be an informational posting to inform those who are planning to sign up for the American Express Delta Skymiles Platinum card so you will have no surprises like there were for us. My wife and I were excited about the promotion they were offering by signing up and receiving 80,000 Skymiles after spending $3,000 in the first 3 months and receiving a \u201cfree complimentary flight\u201d. We wanted to have her mom as our companion since she hasn\u2019t been on a vacation in several years. I already had a card, so I had my wife sign up. Although the benefits looked great on the front end, if you are thinking of signing up, make sure you do your research and dig into the terms and conditions of American Express as well as Delta. Their policies are in conjunction with each other and some terms not stated on American Express will be restrictions with Delta. This made it very difficult when trying to understand exactly what to expect. The annual renewal fee of $250 must be paid in advance for the year meaning, once you sign up for the card, American Express will immediately withdrawal from your account $250. The complimentary companion flight will not be awarded to you until after you have had the card an entire year. When I spoke with a manager on the phone, I asked if the companion flight will be awarded before the next $250 renewal fee would be taken out, he responded with \u201cthey are usually both at the same time\u201d. If you plan to sign up, don\u2019t expect to be awarded the \u201cfree\u201d companion flight before paying two $250 annual renewal fees.<br /><br>Frustrating Customer Service Experience<br /><br>After calling 4 different American Express reps and receiving multiple contradicting statements from when the complimentary flight would be issued to Delta, one rep said the $250 annual charge had never been taken out of our account since the year had not passed. I called back to confirm that it had and the other rep said we would receive the companion flight by May 7th at the latest. The 3rd rep said sometime this month and then came back and said it wouldn\u2019t be until March of next year. I asked to speak with a supervisor, and she put me on hold for 45min and right after she gave me an update saying she was getting the manager on the phone, the music stopped, and the call dropped. I called back the following day and the 4th rep said she would have to create a case and the supervisor would give me a call back in the next 24 hrs. I waited and after receiving no call for 2 days, I called back and the 5th rep was finally able to get me on the phone with a manager. The manager took no time ask about my experience but went straight into why I was wrong for not reading the fine print.<br /><br>I\u2019m big on owning up to faults, I could have done more research to see that the $250 was due up front and that the companion flight was back dated a year, however, because these details are not clearly communicated and it can be very time consuming to keep track of it all (especially when speaking with multiple reps that are giving different information), I wanted to create this post. I just wanted to inform others so that they don\u2019t make the same mistake I did and can save time when making the decision.</p>",

It will take weeks, all in all, to get it resolved, and who knows if they'll even issue me a refund after all that. I've spent hours on the phone trying to sort this out. I was unable to upload my declaration of fraud and had to spend hours again on that. My new card won't arrive for 7-10 days (although if it really arrives when they say it will, I will be shocked.) They take up to 45 days - 45 days!!! - to analyze my fraud claim. Meanwhile, I'm just plain old out the money, and I will probably never see it again. This comes after a situation where they lost my direct deposit for 3 days, so now I won't use that service. All in all, just very disappointed with the recent customer service, and I have 100% lost faith in the security of my account, so even when I eventually do get the new card, after this is resolved I will be closing my account.</p>",

        "content": "<p>American Express has proven to me what ive always suspected from them. That is their double standard approach towards their own customer base. On one hand they have the Amex platinum and Amex gold Card customers and on the opposing end they service the lower echelon clientele with a prepaid product interestingly called Serve. This is a prepaid debit card/checking account mostly used by non credit worthy customers who have yet to establish a good enough credit rating or have somehow soiled their credit rating with late payment history and/or complete defaults on their loans. Whatever the case, regardless of intent or circumstance the results are usually quite negative, and the consequence is the inability to obtain credit cards and loans, as well as insurance policies and in some cases jobs; positions may not be offered or withheld from otherwise qualified deserving candidates. Sadly these same people may have been able in many instances to correct their credit woes if  they could establish gainful employment.  Its a catch 22 and the more misfortunes in ones life the greater the barriers to rebuilding ones life will become. <br /><br>Amex platinum card holders, typically have much more money and disposable income then a Serve card holder may have.  Yet the Serve card has hidden fees for almost any occasion. Try to check your account balance using an atm machine not on the money pass network lately? Well if you do then a fee will be assesed for that privilege. Did you attempt to withdraw an amount greater than your $750 daily limit allows? Try it with serve and you'll be penalized for the attempt. Regardless of network a charge will be assessed for merely attempting. It appears on your account as an overlimit attempt fee of .75 cents. Ever try to contact customer service which they claim is 24 hours. There are no options to reach a live operator at serve unless you are calling to advise them of a lost or stolen card. This is prosperous. There is noone else to speak to regarding anything other then reports of lost or stolen cards. I suggest you speak to those guys regarding anything and everything because theres just no other choice.  Also, lastly i would like to point out the fact that some merchants refuse the serve card because it has no chip function. Considering that Amex cards are accepted in fewer places than the traditional Visa or Mastercards this only adds insult to injury. American Express clearly expresses a bias toward the higher more capable of absorbing miscellaneous fees class of people and a double standard of service and support in their daily course of business.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I don't doubt all these bad reviews because no prepaid card is without some issues but my experience has been great.  I pay a 1.00 monthly fee (which is why I am reluctant to close my account because if I want to open it again, the fee will have gone up I think) I've had this card for a long time and get my paychecks on it.  The only downsides for me have been the out-of-network atm fee totals 5.50 with their fee and the atm's fee and several places I regularly go don't take american express.  I love the reserve account feature which I can move money back and forth as much as I want unlike with my bank account where I can only do it 6 times a month.  I really like the app and I get balance alerts every day and can text BAL to get my balance at any time.  However if you want a comparable card with no fees, switch to american express bluebird.  It is essentially the same except no monthly fee and the reserve account is called a \"setaside\" account.  The only reason I'm switching from bluebird (to Chime) is because again, many places I go don't take amex like goodwill and costco.  Look up chime, it's Visa, no fees, free savings, app etc.  But this serve card has served me well up until now.  Plus you can't get cash back at the register with serve or bluebird either.</p>",

I was only told to wait 4 more weeks, regardless the fact that it has been already over a month.<br /><br>None of the operator I spoke with knew anything about the dispute, they could only see it open on my account but had no idea of what happened. I had to repeat the same story 3 times.<br /><br>I find it unacceptable, if this is the level of service that Amex can provide, I rather use any other less expensive credit card so I canceled my account.<br /><br>Very disappointed, on the phone they sounded very supportive when I opened the dispute but then I realized they did nothing to help.</p>",

At first it said it would be paid on 31st which I paid on the 27th, then it changed to it was delivered on the 27th but to give my financial institution a few days to post payment, then it turned into 5-7 business days then it was oh well if it doesn\u2019t go through by the 7th business day you will be refunded immediately. I asked several times to speak to supervisor and was denied by an \u201c Agent Hart\u201d She told me they have no way of tracking the payment .... said nobody gets a copy of signed check that had been deposited or cashed .... so I asked \u201c you guys just do things all Willy Nilly and hope for the best over there ?!\u201d She sat silent for several moments before saying \u201c okay, seems like we have everything taken care of.\u201d I proceeded to ask \u201c How? My car payment hasn\u2019t been made and you can\u2019t tell me where my money has gone. How is that taken care of?\u201d Again, silence . I call today after she told me my money would be returned immediately if not received by financial institution today and now I\u2019m being told I can either A. Stop payment or B. Receive notice as to where this payment is(mind you this is after \u201c Agent Hart\u201d told me nobody has access to that information). So, I tell her I want both honestly because I want to know where the money went if I don\u2019t have it and the financial institution in which my loan is at doesn\u2019t have it  and I also want my money back!  I need it so I can pay my damn loan since it is now late and the financial institution in which I have my loan reports monthly and this effecting my credit ! She proceeds to tell me \u201c ok, the stop payment with take 10 business days...\u201d I stopped her right there and said \u201c no I want money TODAY! Either I get this money or the bank gets my money for my car payment! I said I asked for a supervisor yesterday and never got one. Today I speak to one and she tells me that it could now only take 2 business days as long as nobody has cashed the check ... that\u2019s right she said that .... how would they know when she again just told me that nobody has access to that information?! So now I get to wait for my money to HOPEFULLY land back in my account somewhere between 2-10 business days MAYBE... oh yeah because she also said in 10 business days I may only receive notice as to what the concluded from their investigation.... taking my money to an ACTUAL bank!! I have had this card for years and this is the first time I\u2019ve tried to use bill pay, this has caused me to choose to just cut my card up and have my funds deposited elsewhere !!</p>",

        "content": "<p>amex emailed me a bonus offer in June of 2019 to open an American Express Magnet Card and receive a $250 statement credit after I spent $1,000 or more in purchases with the new Card within the first 3 months of Card Membership and that I would receive the cash back in the form of a statement credit. So I immediately opened the card and met the requirements yet I never received the statement credit. Today, 01.28.20, I followed up amex and I've been informed that amex did not provide me with the bonus offer because I have been awarded too many bonus offers and therefore not eligible. This statement is completely ridiculous because amex had emailed me with the bonus offer and it is very deceptive marketing for amex to make an offer then later say that I'm not eligible. I was not provided any notice about ineligibility during the application process. amex acted dishonestly with deceptive marketing tactics and should be held to account.</p>",

I was charged a 3% balance transfer fee and i told them to convert me to the AMEX everyday and they wouldnt! They told me to spend more money so i could be a 175 bonus. What the f....Amex really isn't professional and doesn't care if you're happy. They just want all of your money without correcting of caring about the customer's happiness. Now I have a 150$ charge I'll never get back? Amex robbed me and they will do anything to rob you too. Stick with Discover, guys!</p>",

Even though they have been paid on time they stop me from making even small 60 purchases. Latest news never link your bank account with them fraud was committed on my account because they wanted a payment sooner than the due date. Basically they charge my bank account I had on file with them to receive my  money beofre it was actually due. When I called an say hey I didn't submit that payment they said it was nothing they could do about it. Once a payment is made you cant not even on they're end. They tried to say I made the payment but why would I make a payment just to cancel it. They are crooks trust me!</p>",

The only thing my other cards have done that AmEx hasn\u2019t is increase my limit. I have not request this but two of my other CC\u2019s have increased my limit automatically. One of them twice!

My annual renewal is Jan. 5 but I was told by the agent they bill towards the end of the month so I would be subject to the $250 renewal rate.  However, I was billed on Jan. 22, 2019 so this seems really strange and a scam to get the $250 versus $195.  I also inquired about downgrading to the Gold card because I have had ongoing issues with using the companion ticket due to \"unavailability\" and I learned that the companion ticket that I already paid for and was a result of the 2019 membership would be impacted because I didn't use it before my renewal date (apparently in the fine print) --- but I already purchased a ticket will be using it before the expiration date on the voucher!! Watch out people -- lots of fine print and scams.</p>",

Fast Forward a year later and I have established credit history by not missing any payments in in turn have added yet another Wells Fargo Visa card. So after using the Amex PreQualify tool for several weeks i was approved for a Variety of Amex's but was nervous to apply for the card. My Experian Score is a 770 up over 110 points from April 2018 and since Amex Hard Pulls from Experian .. I though why not ... Submitted that application and was instantly approved for a Gold Delta Amex with a starting credit limit of $6000. Merry Christmas to me ... :)</p>",

So thank you you snakes for ripping me off of Christmas money i had saved for my kids Christmas because you don't understand a simple bloody definition of what expire means. well here is the actual definition for your future reference.

When I called the lady on the phone was very rude and told me I should check my bank account before calling because it said there was already a credit on my account. A few days later and nothing in my bank account so I call again and apparently they send checks for refunds after the billing cycle close, which the rude lady before didn't tell me at all. So no I have to wait 3 weeks to get my money back that I needed to pay bills. I will never use American Express for anything else ever again.</p>",

I've barely use the card in many months except to load money on it as an extra savings place for special occasions.  Today, I went to buy groceries for our Thanksgiving dinner, and checked the card balance before I started out.  My account had been closed!!!  I received a message when I logged into my account with a customer service number.  I was absolutely livid!!!  I called the number and some woman answered the line whose English sucked plus 10!!  She explained to me that I hadn't met their company's security requirements!!  What damn security requirements???  She placed me on hold for damn near 30 minutes to talk with the tech department.  I've had that card for a couple of years, and I've never experienced such a thing.  Furthermore, how dare they close my account without any notification?!?!  Where the hell is my money??!!  I work too damn hard to save money and have it taken from me like this.  I haven't done a damn thing but place money on the card!!  I haven't used it to purchase a freaking thing in months.  We use it to save money for special occasions.  That pathetic heifer of a customer service rep verified my home mailing address and email, and told me that a check for the amount of money I had on the card had been sent to me on 11/23/19.  I actually asked the good Lord to please save my life because I was so angry, I though I was going to have a coronary!!  My money better be in my mailbox with a quickness!!  Amex Serve damn near ruined our Thanksgiving!!  Thanks a lot you corrupt, maggots!!  May the jaws of hell snatch your hearts out!!  My family will go on with it's Thanksgiving, be blessed and enjoy the season in spite of you minions from hell.  You may have snatched my joy temporally, but you will never make believe there are not still good people out there.  In your case, God must have blinked!!!!  CONSUMERS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CARD!!  DO NOT GET THIS CARD!!!!  STAY AWAY FROM AMEX SERVE PERIOD!!!</p>",

Today I called again and asked for my statement balance and was told its several thousand less than listed on statement. I asked them to send me an email in writing so I can pay this amount but they said they have to mail it and it takesb7 days. My balance is due in 3. They cannot email.

That's so disappointing. <br /><br /><br>So, whenever you call in, here is just an example. You may ask, what is my available credit? Then ask another person 60 seconds later and ask the same question. Then listen to how the answer changes immediately and differently. This applies to the non-preset card limit card and others. Plus, when using this card out in public you really don't know if you will be rejected or not. It's always a guessing game. <br /><br /><br>Personally, I have charged thousands on this card and always pay it off immediately to save money. But when I use it, I make sure I have a backup card because with this card you really never know when it will be rejected or accepted. It is like walking on thin ice with this card. I don't like gambling when it comes to credit.<br /><br /><br>Again, whenever I use this card, I pay it off immediately, it takes up to three months for the bureaus to show a zero balance. This just isn't right. But if you call the bureaus, they will say it's the creditors' fault for reporting it slow. If you call the creditor, then they say it's the bureaus fault. no one takes accountable for this.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Grows quickly however Amex seems to have a problem mailing me my card. I had to have them overnight me a replacement card after they said it was delivered. If it was indeed delivered, it certainly wasn't in my hands. Both of my amex cards have had this same issue. Unsurprisingly, I always seem to get their promotional mailers offering me new cards. I've had the same issue on both of my cards. Rewards take quite some time to post and despite the name, don't ever expect to get an actual American on the line when calling customer service. Use for groceries only and cash out when you hit 25 bucks. The contactless RFID chip also broke in a few months but I'm not about to go through the hassle requesting another card considering their deficiencies in sending me the previous ones. For no annual fee it's sufficient but it's not something anyone should be pining for.</p>",

They want outrageous \"membership fees\" for their rip off credit cards. Pray you never have unexpected financial problems because their heartless customer service will only be rude and snarky about it. Oh, and if you pay late one month because of unexpected issues, they will forfeit your earned points, but don't worry you can get your points back IF YOU PAY MONEY TO REINSTATE THEM! AND DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IT TAKES TO EQUAL POINTS TO BEGIN WITH! Total joke of a card. I have multiple credit cards with tremendous customer service and rewards. I've never experienced such a horrible system with any other credit card company. I will never utilize this credit card again and wish I had never signed up for it in the first place!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Having the worst customer service experience EVER and I just received the card YESTERDAY!  In the airport, when I applied for my card, I was promised benefits that correspond to a Platinum Card but only received a \"gold card\".  When I called Sky Miles Club personnel (Philip and his manager, Tessa) to complain about being misled, I was told that all I had to do was call AMEX and they would automatically \"upgrade\" me to a Platinum card (which is $250/yr charge vs $99).  So when I called AMEX to make this \"upgrade\" happen, I was told by Leah and her manager, Charmaine, that I could NOT automatically be upgraded to a Platinum card until a year has passed.  (Um, hello, I am offering to pay you $150 more, I have excellent credit, and I make plenty of money to qualify).  THEN they had the nerve to suggest I get TWO cards, a Gold AND a Platinum card (two separate accounts) and stated that I could qualify for a DIFFERENT Platinum card right away.  So they are trying to manipulate me into having TWO credit cards- DIFFERENT accounts!! If this isn't deliberate, fraudulent customer service, I do not know what is.  All because I wanted to simply have access to the Sky Club, as I travel with Delta all the time.  Correction:  I USED to travel with Delta all the time.  Sorry Delta, you took two hours from my morning...for nothing...I have no desire to give you business any longer.</p>",

Customer service was helpful and they did all they could to help. I don't know what has happened in the past couple of years, but this is not a good card to have anymore. Lately, every time I have to receive a refund, the mechant will release the funds (and it will show, in green, the funds are back in the account on the app) but Amex will hold them for upwards of 7 days! When you call to get an explanation, they lie and will tell you 2/3 different dates depending on which rep answers the phone. Just today I had a rep tell me that maybe I called and \"rushed\" amazon to send my refund and that's why it came faster &amp; when I told him \"no, I never even had to call amazon\" he just repeated the same lie, blaming the banks for holding the funds. Then insisted that he didn't have a manager or dept head that I could talk to. I will be cancelling this card AS SOON as they refund my money. It's not worth the headache or inconvenience, just get a visa.</p>",

The direct deposit money has always come on time but that's really not them is it? I have had a number of issues with money being taken from my account but never returned. There is always a reason why but not a valid reason. I cannot contact them to stop recurring charges that are not even mine which is customme a lot of money but i can't talk to anyone. I can'temail anyone. I have to send a letter to their office and hope its in the time frame they give. If not they deny the claim which they have doneto me and that's after they sent me the letter late saying i had a limited amiunt of time. They just don't like to return money. Use another company.

We couldn't even sit next to each other and the seats were not what I had originally booked.  The travel dept was a joke during the entire experience.

Tell me how this is acceptable.<br /><br /><br>I charged my card at my relative's business. Card gets declined. I call in to find out my account is currently getting cancelled due to \"conflict of interest\" without any notice or warning. It's been literally 2 days since I opened the card from the mail. This is how you treat your customers? <br /><br /><br>Yeah sure, it's my relative's business (my little sister if that really matters). But I'm here to support her and pay for her services. How is an invoice and physical goods not enough proof? She runs a t-shirt printing company! She would have to order the tees and print it for me. Nowhere on the card agreement form mentions you can't spend your money on family! I didn't even know this was a thing. This is probably the most absurd and ridiculous experience I have ever gone through. <br /><br /><br>Most of my family members are small business owners. You are stating I cannot support any one of them because they are affiliated to me?

For the Most Part, I like the Bluebird Card, I have Two Teenagers and I opened Family Accounts with their NAmes on their Own Cards. Teaches Teens Money Management! Also, I can instantly Transfer Funds to My Teenagers and I like that a lot. Now, if We can just Get Amex Bluebird to Instantly Transfer the Funds Back to Us, the Cardholders when a Merchant and/or hotel Releases a Hold on our Card or Refunds Monies back via Returned Item or CRedit. I understand that AMEX has to Make Money Someway with this FEE FREE Card, so I really Don't Complain about this one Little Greed FActor, However, as Many others have Stated on this Forum, I really Really Really Needed the Funds Credited Back ASAP on a Target Store Purchase-Refund, and Amex  has Not Even Posted Pending on the Refund and it been two Business Days. I understand they Exercise their Entire 5-7 Days Right to Earn Interest across Thousands of Account Holders, But it Absolutely Hurts when I'm a Disabled Single Father that Uses Bluebird as my Main Debit Card for Essentials Such as Gas, Groceries and Bill payments. Well, this Month My Kids are Suffering because of Amex Debit Card Refund Policy. Seems They are Treating this Debit Card as a Credit Card? And Making us Suffer Long- Extremely Long Delays to Get back our Money when a Store Credit and or Refund is processed by a  merchant.<br /><br>Hope the FTC and or Financial Bureau of Consumer Affairs Steps in to Help American Express Correct this 5-7 Day Wait Time they have Chosen to make us Endure and Declare it Unconstitutional! <br /><br>If FDIC is going to Allow Amex Bluebird to Act like and Be Insured Like a Banking institution, then they Must Be required to Uphold the Same Standards as Banks, i.e. Release the Funds Back immediately such as Banks are Required to Do, when the Card is Used as Debit for the Transaction. Come on Bluebird, you guys should be ashamed of yourselves.<br /><br>Love your Card, Just Hate this one Little Policy that Most Likely Makes Amex a Fortune and Causes the Least of us Card Holders Heartache and in my Case, this Week, Took Food of My Kids Table.</p>",

After 6 more months, asked for $7,500 &amp; got it.<br /><br /><br>As added perks, AMEX BCE cardholders gets an Experian FICO score, refreshed monthly, in addition to a no cost ShopRunner membership, where one can order from many participating stores &amp; get 2 day business shipping. Think of the money saved in shipping fees, there's something for everyone. Of course, this doesn't include Amazon.<br /><br /><br>In the less than a year of having the card, still in the 0% promo, have racked enough points to redeem for two payments (or statement credits). Some may call it a con, the minimum payment is $35, or less if the balance is below that.<br /><br /><br>The AMEX site is also very user friendly &amp; easy to navigate. I highly recommend the BCE card for everyday needs, and families can double the rewards with the upgraded card which comes with a $95 annual fee. The only places where rewards are the lowest are warehouse clubs (Costco) &amp; supercenters (Walmart), yet one still gets 1% back at these places.<br /><br /><br>I don't leave home w/out my AMEX BCE card.</p>",

The system would not let me do this. I called and spoke to 3 people. The first two kept telling me that was just \"how it was. The system chose to not let me link any more debit cards.\" They could not explain why. They kept saying \"nobody did it, the system did it. Nobody knows why, it can't be undone.\" I finally got through to a supervisors supervisor and was told that it was a fraud prevention measure. \"I have been using the account for years, and now I can't link a  debit card to it anymore? \" I was told, \"yes, that is for your own convenience and protection.\" So, how do I get money on the account?  \"You go to Walmart and add it.\"<br /><br> Standing in line at Walmart to add money to the card? I don't think so. Can it be reversed off my account? \"No, it will be forever. You can never link a debit card to this account again.\" Why? Because the system said so.\"<br /><br /><br>Well, I told them what their system can do. I would transfer the money out of this account and close my Blue bird for good. But, guess what? I won't let me get my money, because I do not have a linked bank account!

I tried contacting them with a request many times by phone and by email. They kept putting me on hold and referring me to someone else! All I wanted was an invoice for the hotel that I booked through the agency portal and that theyyyy paid for! The hotel is not able to provide this because I used them as an intermediate party ! Big mistake ! Amex france invoice department gave futile promesses about editing the invoice and sending it by email. I never received anything! I had to beg the hotel to send me the invoice. If they are unable to provide proper service for hotel bookings and not only travel bookings, they should not suggest this to clients. I have never seen such disregard of clients needs ! Even if my company is the client !</p>",

I was approved with a $7200 starting limit, which I thought was fine, and I really liked that because I'm already an American Express cardholder, I was approved with only a soft pull. A couple days later, I received a letter in the mail informing me that the $7200 credit limit for the Cash Magnet was being deducted from the credit limit of my Blue Cash Preferred card which had a $14,000 limit. It's now been reduced to $6800. This is bait and switch. Had I known American Express would do such a thing, I never would have applied. I've always loved Amex, and I've had a great relationship with them for the past 19 years, but this just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. According to the letter, I can call to reallocate the credit limits. Because I don't want to tank my credit scores by closing the new account, I think my best bet is to reallocate all but $500 back to my Blue Cash Preferred and then sock drawer the Cash Magnet. If you're already an American Express credit card holder, you might want to think twice about applying for the Cash Magnet or any other additional American Express credit card.</p>",

What if there was an emergency and someone needed money now. Well today I went to transfer 200.00 more and kept getting an error. So i got on my computer to do and then it said I had already transferred money today. UMMM, NO I DIDNT. So I called to find out what the problem was. Then i find out that it is 200.00 a day in their time zone now my own which is complete bull. I transferred at 9pm my time but of course it was midnight there. The only message you get when you go to transfer is the limit is 200.00 a day. Maybe they should put in there that they go by eastern time. So mad because my son really needed this money by today.</p>",

Last year I was at my bank for unrelated business, and was asked if I was interested in applying for a credit card, I said \"sure, why not?\".  Shortly after, the \"declined\" letter came in the mail, Annoyed, I checked my credit online and discovered that I have no credit history and NO FICO score at all, zero! <br /><br>On a whim and in total disregard to online advice, I applied for an American Express Blue Cash Everyday card.  Amex quickly responded and wanted to check my income taxes, so I printed &amp; signed the form. When I mailed it, I also included a short personalized letter to them explaining why my credit history was basically empty, that I owned my vehicles out-right &amp; had no debt, and that I wanted to become a trusted Amex customer and start getting credit for my responsibility. <br /><br>Three weeks later to the day, I got a welcome email! They had accepted me, and with a nice big-boy credit limit! I was so elated that I even bragged about it at work, and they couldn't believe that I got approved for an Amex card with no FICO score! Perhaps I got lucky, but they put their trust in me, and I am loyal to them for that. So far, I have nothing but good things to say about American Express. I called them and they were super-friendly, too. <br /><br>My tip for people in situations like mine is to write American Express a (short) personal letter and sign your name to it, in addition to only clicking buttons on a computer screen and filling out forms. <br /><br>I learned my lesson about credit, too! Maintaining excellent credit is my new passion. My wife is already sick of watching the credit videos with me on YouTube!</p>",

I contacted American Express because my husband paid his bill automatically from one of HIS bank accounts.  I called the company to ask that a paper statement be sent to me, so I could pay what he owed.  Let me be clear, I had a card on this very account and was listed on the account.  He was the primary account holder, but i was an intregal part of the information.<br /><br>After being transferred from one person to another, and LONG waiting periods, I was connected to a person from (You guessed it!). INDIA&gt;. I could not understand a word she said.  Finally, after some rude questions, I just said SEND ME A BILL and hung up.  I was in tears.  <br /><br>American Express advertises about their great customer service.  RIGHT! No company that wants to serve you uses a call center in INDIA!  The story is not over!  Did I get a paper statement?  On no, they have turned me over to a bill collector.  <br /><br>Let me clarify.  My credit rating is excellent. I have contacted the other companies (Discover, Visa, etc).  They have simply changed the address and sent me the bill to rectify.  On most of those, I  wasn't even listed on the account info.<br /><br>My final word to the wise. Don't believe those claims of CUSTOMER SERVICE made by this horrible company.  If you want to check it out, I am sure that someone in India can really give you a sales talk!  Or, perhaps the debt collector?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Like most other people I have been a victim of fraud and American Express Serve is doing nothing about it. My question is why do the charges need to post before they are disputed? Once i realized my card had been cloned and used fraudulently on Feb 7 I called right away and all the charges were still pending. They told me they could not begin the dispute process until they posted! Why is there no option to void pending transactions? Especially from a company like Amex. So the next day Feb 8th i checked my account again and most of the charges had posted with the exception of 2 (merchant never collected the money for 2 fraud transactions so i guess it released on its own) I have all my confirmation emails stating the dispute has been filed but i dont have time to wait 21-45 days for these dumb asses to investigate. Stay far away from this card people! I got this card out of desperation because I was in the chex systems and couldn't get my own bank account due to my PNC account being compromised years before. The only thing i really liked was that i get paid two days earlier but that shit doesn't even matter anymore. Hardly anyone takes Amex and overall it's a hassle. I couldn't even withdraw my own money in Dominican Republic back in September because it's not a real bank and you can't use it internationally. Some BS! Why wouldn't you be able to use an Amex worldwide?! Stay far far away!</p>",

If someone returns money back to you they will post it and then place on hold so you are thinking your money had returned and it hasn't.

If you want to schedule a cash pickup, you have to go to Walmart. <br /><br>I am not a fan of limitations. There are many times I am frustrated because I can't simply walk into my bank, fill out a withdrawal slip, and walk out with $2,000 cash. <br /><br>You just cant. You have to do it through Walmart, or find an ATM and still be limited to $750 a day. <br /><br>There still are no chips on these cards. <br /><br>If you have any refunds/returns expected, also expect to have your patience tested for 7-10 business days. Holds are ridiculous, and transfers are just as bad. <br /><br>There are useful, quick bits of information we are used to (or expect to have access to) about our accounts and I don't think the Bluebird app delivers. You're very limited in what you can do on it, and what information you can see. <br /><br>I really hate having to call customer service. It's not an awful experience, but it is always foreign based, and helpful MOST of the time. You'll get real customer service at a real bank. <br /><br>You will run into many situations where a vendor doesn't even accept American Express cards and you're just SOL unless you have PayPal or the time to wait 7 business days for a bill to be paid from your bank account. <br /><br>My income has changed since 2012, and I deal with bigger transactions now, larger deposits, and larger amounts that need to be moved from account to account or be pulled in cash and this card just doesn't work for any of that anymore. <br /><br>I'm looking into a local, physical bank but as you can expect that is never easily done when everything has been with another for the past 8 years. <br /><br>This is a good card if you have a small income, because you will probably never have fees. <br /><br>If you have a larger income it is just not worth it. <br /><br>I don't even think they're FDIC, but don't quote me on that.&amp;#x2026; read more</p>",

I had a Discover, Visa, Mastercard, store cards, and Amex. I missed payments for 4 months. Not good I realize, but what are you going to do? Pay your rent and utilities or your credit cards? So, when I got a job after 4 months  I was able to negotiate with each card to stop all late fees and remove interest and set up a payment plan with all cards EXCEPT AMEX.  All the other cards let me pay 0% once I got on an automatic payment plan and they did not mark me as late because I didn't pay the full amount I owed at that point. Not AMEX. They continued to mark me late for over a year after I was making regular on time payments. So, my credit score is still screwed today 8 years later because of them. I tried to call customer service to have this removed seeing as I was paying them an agreed amount that THEY agreed to. NO, just got the run around and of course my credit reports remained stained. I hate AMEX and I actually used to work for them. No special treatment for employees that's for sure. If you have this card, you better plan on never paying late or being unemployed or any other bad thing happening because they don't care. Your credit will be screwed for 7+ years.</p>",

I went to the ATM, the ATM was not out of money  or malfunctioning because the second transaction went through. However, the first transaction for 200$ did not dispense money. I am told to wait 45 days to get this money back. I just want to warn people that even with Wal-Mart money cards if the ATM doesn't dispense money its ten days.  I thought ten days was a lot but what if it had been 400$.  Does American express really think everyday people who for whatever reason have to put their money on prepaid cards can wait 45 days for hundreds of dollars to be returned? Its sad. And I think about people out of work who this is happening to and it sickens me.  I don't even feel confident the money will be returned in 45 days. It just feels like a scam. So to all of the raters including wallet hub who recommend this card, What did I do wrong in this case? How did I bring this on myself?</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is a cash back card 1.5% on EVERYTHING. With recent news of credit card companies cutting back on rewards on their high percentage points card, this simple 1.5% still stays....on everything. Actually not bad at all and I dont have to figure out which categories to use this on since I just use it on everything.... and I still get 1.5% cash back. I know it does not sound much to other people but so far my rewards have stacked up quite well. They have an internal catalog shop for reward items from clothing to gift cards to elctronics even car accesories. Heck I got a Sony 55\" TV using my rewards from this.  Love this card!</p>",

The resort puts a $50 per day hold on the card for incidents, which gets returned. Apparently Amex Serve also increases all hotel and resort charges by 25%, to cover incidentals. You will not receive any of this back for 8 days. The second I receive my refunds after their mysterious 7 day hold, I'm withdrawing all my funds and closing the account. Already transferred my direct deposit to my bank. I'll happily get my check one day later to not deal with this scam company.</p>",

I've called twice between June and today, spent a total of 2 hours on the phone, and they still haven't sent the card.  The first time I called was October 25, 2018 because I hadn't received the card and still hadn't received a response from them. At this time, they said that they would reissue me another one, confirmed my address, and said I should expect it in about a month.  I waited 6 weeks keeping an eye out for it in the mail.  Still hadn't received it so opened a chat in the American Express Chat window to see if they could check on it.  After chatting for about 10 minutes they said something about how they saw the request from 10/25 and that someone would contact me in 3-5 business days or I could call the rewards number.  I call this number and talk to a lady that tells me that they never reissued a card and that she will try to do it on her end.  After another 45 minutes on the phone and being put on hold multiple times, she tells me that she is having an error on her end on entering the address for it to be sent (you should already have my address and why is this a problem?).  I talked to a supervisor who claimed that he can see the reward dollars I have and that I requested an Amazon gift card but that they have an error on their end and they will call me back in 7-10 business days.  Also, they claim that they cannot send emails or text messages whatsoever, including any confirmations or letting me know if and when the card has been sent. What a load of crap...they are just avoiding giving me the reward dollars that I earned.  Poor customer service....go with a different credit card that is actually going to do what they say.</p>",

No one accepts it, even in Canada. <br /><br /><br>Very easy to get slapped with their late fee of $39....no \"payment due\" alerts. <br /><br /><br>Their argument is that for most charges, there's this additional grace period until the end of billing cycle. However, the late fees get charged on typically the charges that are occurring just before the end of billing cycle - so the grace period doesn't apply to all charges. I have been a long time owner of this corp card (20+ yrs) but getting increasingly disgusted with their business practices. Looks like AmEx has opted to make the late fees a revenue stream. Looks like they want the customers to default on payments. They know that it takes 20+ days to get expense reports to get processed through a company's accounts dept. They know that today's professional does not have time to keep tab of each expense and the number of days from their payment statements. AmEx has removed the alerts options so they don't warn you that payment will be due in say 10 days or 5 days. As soon as the late fee is slapped, they will be sure to send you an alert :) so they surely do have the technology to do it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have been using an Amex serve card for my payroll direct deposit. It's a big enough pain that so many places don't take Amex because of the high fees they're charged by the company. Then finding an atm that won't charge a fee comes into play. Yesterday my direct deposit was sent and not released to my card by Amex. When I called I was told it is \"technical difficulties\" and there was not estimated time of it being fixed, but if I called my employer to get a trace number they could tell me when it would be deposited. I was dumbfounded by this response and called back to speak to someone else. They would not give me a supervisor but the second woman told me it should be by the end of the day. This morning it's still not there so I call them and get a message \"we're sorry we're experiencing technical difficulties please try your call again later\" I get this message 3 times. Then I decided to block my number and call again and sure enough I'm on hold now being told \"all of our agents are currently busy, please hold for the next available agent.\" This isn't some new deposit they need to insure will clear, this is my paycheck that they have always cleared before, clearly an unreasonable hold. Not to mention that they didn't notify any of their customers that there was an issue. I could have requested a check be cut, or changed my direct deposit to somewhere else, and I damn sure would not have taken my car to the mechanic if I had known I wouldn't be able to get it back due to this issue. I'm 2 hours away from contacting a lawyer at this point.</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you think that American Express will help you when a business cheats, think again. I had an Amex card for decades but when I had a problem with a car rental overcharge earlier this year it was the merchant that Amex supported. The company was Hertz in Mexico. I had a confirmed reservation with a price of $181.80. That price included, itemized $65.85 in fees and taxes. When I returned the car the Hertz agent claimed there was accident damage. That was not true and what he referred to was a loose panel under the front bumper. It was noted on the inspection slip when picking the car up. When the statement arrived Hertz had charged $379.21. I filed a dispute with Amex. Then contacted Hertz and Hertz claimed the additional was for fees and taxes. When I pointed out that of the original $181.80 $65.85 was already added for fees and taxes and that it would be absurd for a rental charge of $115.95 to have fees and taxes totaling $263.26. This went back and forth over several months and Amex just supported Hertz. I decided it was simply not worth more of my time and gave up, but not before closing out my American Express account. All the details are posted at: <a href=\"http://www.larryluckham.com/2018-Hertz/On%20January%2012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.larryluckham.com/2018-Hertz/On%20January%2012.pdf</a> for anyone interested. <br /><br>My advice; 1) Don't ever rent a car from Hertz; and 2) Don't ever use an American Express card.</p>",

Besides the horrible wait times and rude representatives, every-time I call I'm greeted by someone from India who barely speaks english and is ill equipped in providing the minimum level of customer service necessitated for a charge card. To give one example, a few weeks ago Amex totally dropped the ball and had some IT issues and wiped my 3X Amazon point offer from my account after it had expired. Worse, they removed the useful offer tab that said \"expired\" so the only proof I had was a screenshot of the offer as this has happened to me before. Now, a loyal member with a significant point balance that calls about something like this should be greeted with an immediate apology and a reinstatement of the points but instead I was told I had to wait 3-5 business days for the \"back-office\" to sort the issue. I guess even when you exploit underpaid and destitute workers in Mumbai to enhance your bottom line it stills takes significant time for a simple issue but I'm a reasonable guy so I wait.. and wait... and wait. Nearly 10 business days later I call back and they say sorry we're still working on it, you need to wait at least another 15 BUSINESS DAYS. When I escalated the situation they totally lied and mentioned the hurricane even though the original time period they had given me lapsed well before the hurricanes onset.... When I asked to cancel the card the representative offered me 20,000 points but I would rather keep my dignity than dance with the devil that is American Express.<br /><br /><br>In summation, if you like speaking to exploited Indian CSR's who can't help you, being lied to, and being cheated after being a customer for six years, do business with Amex.</p>",

You  pay  them  when  due.  get  along  just  fine.</p>",

Had to use another card, later found out the there was a hold on AMEX serves site for the $209.58, a hold that will not clear for 7 DAYS!! The store shows a decline on the card I have proof with the receipt. But AMEX Serve will not release the funds! So at this point I have paid $419 for $209 worth of groceries! This is the second time they have done this to me! As soon as the funds clear back to my balance I am closing the account</p>",

I didn't even know may account was closed until i checked my mailbox when i came back in town. I needed to book a trip ASAP! But i don't have any account anymore. Nobody could help me when i called into Customer Service Saturday. They just transferred me around and around until they just hung up on me. After a hour i talk with someone in the fraud department which was the manager and she was the only that could really help me. But i had to wait until today (which is Monday) to get the (special team) whoever that is.... to active my account again. I'm so pissed!!!! The flight has went up and someone needs to fix this problem. I used this card for my business. Oh i forgot to tell you how they sent me a new card in the mail that they cancel before i got it! lol Help Jesus</p>",

I called on the 8th day and another representative told me \"no one put in the request\" the last time I spoke to them. Now i'm being transferred 10 different times to 10 different people trying to figure out when I will get my money back. American Express and AMEX Serve you all should just eat shit and die. You have no idea how hard it is for Americans to make their money and you just sit there and avoid fraud on your customers accounts. Shame on you and I pray your business fails.

I never had a hold put on my funds, as I transfer my money from one card to this one. Money is there asap, or I either load for free at Walmart. NO fees are involved with this card that is a win win all together. True enough everyone doesn't accept Amex/Express, but more than enough merchants do to make using the card still pleasant. I use it for my trips. I have reserved hotels, made purchases with no problems. I got the card to not have to worry about theft, and unauthorized charges to my bank debit card which is of course attached to my bank account. Now that was a headache! If used properly this is a excellent card the free send money feature to another card holder which my son is also a cardholder, has been wonderful. I have had the card now 2 years and none of the issues stated here, have I had. I tried other prepaid debit cards that come with a bunch a hidden fees and fees to load. This card is great Lyft even accepts them now....The card has truly served it's purpose for me. Another thing consumers need to start doing is reading the pkg and fine print. Don't be so quick to load money on a card that may not be suited for you. read more</p>",

I continue to tell him my problem he cuts me off again.. by now I\u2019m like how can you help me with my problem if you keep talking over me!? He kept talking so I listened. I then went to speak again &amp; then he cuts me off again by then I got really frustrated and I told him off without cursing. I requested to speak with a manager &amp; he  immediately transfered me.. I then sat on the phone for 30+ minutes waiting to speak with someone..

Luckily I got that resolved. I had money taken out so many times from other account and different transactions from weird places. Not too long ago I had a transaction made from someone named \"Loraine Sasser\". This lady hacked into my online account and made a direct deposit of all my money into her account and left me with nothing but $0.98. So I called the bank and was on the phone for 2hrs trying to get my issue resolved and I got no where. I suggested they give me a credit or speed up the process and got nothing. This is the worst prepaid card out there. You are probably better off getting green dot. Honestly do not get it. The costumer service representatives are not helpful at all.</p>",

No calls were getting through. We were not able to access any funds on our card including the funds that were on the card prior to the Tax Refund. <br /><br>AmEx says they received to many funds at once and it crashed their system. <br /><br /><br>Direct Deposits- Like clockwork in the beginning we received our direct deposit on schedule almost down to the minute. After the tax refund issue they began to hold direct deposits. Some times they would not come until the day of. I called and they stated that as soon as the money hits their account they distribute the funds. Well, my company gave me documentation of when the money was sent to my account and I got it the following week. They had not answer for what happened. This has happened on more than a dozen occasions. I have even had problems with my son SSI and my husbands job. So they can't say it was \"my companies fault\". <br /><br /><br>Refunds- Whether its a refund for a product you return or gas purchased I was told that they could take up to 30 days to refund the money. Really? 30 days. <br /><br /><br>Customer Service: Pointless. As a matter of fact, I noticed that if you have an issue their system suddenly shuts down. This is like every other call. <br /><br /><br>I am starting to think that they are taking advantage of us by holding our money to gain interest on it. Now I have a bank account where I don't have these problems. I guess this is a common thing which is why most stores don't want to accept American Express.</p>",

They have the option to set up sub accounts with their own cards plus a savings account. Customer service is pretty good and the app/website is easy to use especially to move money between the sub accounts. Only major down side is the checks are expensive and they have a pre-approval process which isn't a big deal but giving someone a check from them kind of gives away the fact that your using a prepaid card but it does assure them that it's good.</p>",

Very deceptive. Now there's a minimum of $270 for a $6k dollar balance. I'm transferring to another card and closing. 29% is ungodly.</p>",

My credit score is slightly just over 750.  I've received pre-approved offers before from the Blue Cash &amp; Preferred cards but disregarded them but I decided to give them a try this time and I'm glad I did.  I will submit an updated review in approximately 6 month but for now I give them 5 stars.  I've already transferred a balance upon signing up and received a $60 credit just for waiting for my card to come in the mail which will cover my transfer fee.  I'm looking forward to making this card my everyday card and reap the cash back rewards for what I use most, groceries and gas.  I've also talked to customer service a couple of times and used their online chat and all times they were very helpful.</p>",

I spent 12.00 in atm fees last week because I needed to pay my rent and I didn\u2019t realize WALMART doesn\u2019t have money pass ATMs anymore. Many places don\u2019t accept American Express which causes chaos when you have a buggy full of groceries. The bill pay option is amazing.  Honestly some big banks I\u2019ve had didn\u2019t have those type of features.  It basically is a bandaid for one of Serve\u2019s bigger flaws, Many of the bills I paid online didn\u2019t accept American Express so I had to set them up as a biller which got the bill paid but I\u2019ll be honest it took a lot longer. I like the sub accounts. They made giving my wife money hassle free.  I went at the review in a Serve vs Bank account mindset.  Serve however beats every other prepaid card out there. But still I rate it 3/5, if serve was more broadly accepted in my area and had more free ATMs. I would keep the service.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I only have this card because I had to file chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 2017, since I can't even get a credit union to let me open an account.  Anyways, this card is great and it's nice to get direct deposit 2 days early, but it never deposits at the same time or even close to it.  My company submits payroll on Sunday and normally employees get paid Thursday, but I get my check on Tuesday usually anywhere from 12pm-1230pm or anywhere from 4-5pm or anywhere from 11pm-12am.  I called them and asked why the time is always different and they said that if I don't receive a deposit by 7pm I wont get it, which is a lie because I got my check a few times after 11pm.  Somehow every so often my account goes negative a few dollars which I don't understand because I thought these things were supposed to stop you from going over.  I don't get charged for this but it's kind of annoying and I know I can budget myself but still lol .  A lot of places don't even accept American Express, I was at taco bell and had to leave the drive-thru and find an ATM because they don't accept this card.  Walmart said they are not allowed to unload these cards only load, so it's kind of dumb if i need to get money off of it without using an ATM.  I had to call customer service a few times and they were helpful.  I had almost $800 on it and used my card at a gas pump and received a $50 hold which I'm guessing is the gas stations thing, but I thought these cards were supposed to withdraw the funds right away towards a purchase so the hold is kind of stupid.  I've never truly had a pending purchase, it always shows up right away and shows the funds that I spent.  Overall if you have trouble getting a bank account, this card is the way to go.  There are a lot of free ATMS to use these at but make sure you check prior if the place you're at accepts American Express.  A lot of stores told me that AE is expensive to use, so that's why they don't accept them.  I would recommend getting the card through the Bluebird website so you don't have to buy the kit in store.  Mine shipped fast.  Another issue I have had is when I received my taxes, I had well over $2000 and went to purchase a Walmart money order to pay rent and I was denied, sometimes it will ask you for the security code which can be either the 4 digit one on the front OR the 3 digit one on the back.  I don't care what anyone says, but I have had to use both codes at different times.</p>",

Fast forwarding 14 months later, I get a call from a collection agency saying Verizion never received payment. I contacted Verizon Corporate department. They believe my payment went through American Express via an ACH transaction. Verizon requested me to get an ACH Transmittal report from American Express.  I made several phone calls, wrote several letters.. Even sent a certified letter with signature required.. They can't help me because its been over a year. The amount of time to dispute the charge ran out.. I'm not disputing the charge, I just want information where the money went.. Apparently they can't keep track of where my money went. I'll probably have to pay this bill again to clear it.. Otherwise the service is alright, Sometimes I get frustrated if I go to a restaurant,  buy gas at pay at the pump, stay at the hotel a grossly high amount of money is put on hold until things process. At least now if I gas up at Shell, the automatic hold seemed to drop from $75.00 to $50.00.. I haven't been able to figure out a flat percentage on what Amex figures for a tip.. Sometimes its 30%.. Sometimes 20%.. Sometimes 40%... I recently loaded my tax refund on there when i did my taxes with Turbo Tax, and the money was on the card in a few days. I like the serve account for some of the features, putting money on reserve is an excellent security feature.. Sub Accounts are good. I don't like the fact that customer service representatives are outsourced with strong accents.. They need to hire more Americans..</p>",

It was declined 2 times, there was plenty of money on my card.  I then googled and found out they had shut down because of being over loaded.  Finally 13 hours later 1am I was able to use my app again and saw they had charged my account anyways even though it was declined.  I sat on the phone for 1 hour till Julie answered and her spew of it's not our fault that your card was declined.  And I have to wait for them to decide if it was my auto insurance company who declined the card or I didn't have any money in my account. I told her to look my account and I have plenty of money I'm my account. She called me a lier and oh well if I don't get my money back.  Horrible customer service ever.  Don't use this company everyone. After I get my money off the card I'm cutting it up.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Expedia has taken over the booking for American Express Platnium travel customers. There is no longer a way to get customer service or leave a review.  Dead links everywhere.  When you book a fine hotel and resort and you show up they list you as Expedia and you don\u2019t get the contracted upgrades.  I recently spent $10k on a few days in a hotel and had to ask 3 times for what was suppose to be contracted from the AmEx travel website. I finally asked what they had me listed as and they told me, indignantly, Expedia. When I told them AmEx fine hotels and resorts they spent the next two days apologizing but the problem was my stay was already mostly over. Happened again with the rental car, I\u2019m put into a line with a bunch of chain smoking, price shopping, red necks and listed like Expedia again and the guy behind the counter treats me like it. You prepay the fee so when my contract is up I won\u2019t renew AmEx platnium. I spend and pay off $50k-$100k a month on the card.  This card I have had for 5 years and it\u2019s no longer worth it. The 5x and 30% points back is a joke. You won\u2019t be able to figure it out and it\u2019s a \u201cgotcha\u201d mantality. Good luck.  They are trying to be more like every other card, but they still keep transaction cost high and take profits. Call center turned into garbage as well. They don\u2019t know what they use to and the Customer XP is raspberries. No friend to small business.</p>",

Transaction cannot be disputed until it's been fully completed. After they finally allow you to file dispute you must wait 6 business days before they will credit the funds back to your card. If you cancel a transaction either just a minute or two after the initial transaction American Express has already taking the money from your account. Despite having the supporting documentation showing the cancellation MedExpress will hold  will keep your money 8 more business days until the pending transaction and their system lapses as a result of merchant inaction. There's no excuse for this except laziness and greed on the part a company take advantage of the customers that can least afford it. Shame on you</p>",

So I started to add everything up to see where the confusion took place from that day. And I got more confused. So I started all the way to the day I opened my account. And realized the more I used my card the more money disappeared. First it was 7.00 one month that was miscalculated. And by the time I finished i'm missing over 300.00 because apparently there computer can't count when adding up your transactions. I called customer service and some lady that you can understand to much went back to my last deposit which was like 5 days and I didn't use my card a lot so of course those three transactions she went over added up. I'm talking about over a few months money's coming up missing.</p>",

There are no cash reload fees at CVS, Family Dollar, 7 Eleven, Walmart and Rite Aid.  There is a monthly fee of $4.95 except for customers in NY, VT and TX.   The blue and silver serve cards have a cash reload fee because the silver has a 1% cash payback program and the blue card is $1 per month.  The green serve card doesn't charge an ATM withdrawal fee at Money Pass locations.  Additionally, getting cash at US Bank and TFC bank ATM'a, it is completely free from both banks.  There is a reserve savings account attached with no interest and subaccounts for  o additional charge.  The foreign transaction fee is 2.7% which is less thsn the average card.  Most establishments and retailers now accept American Express but it is wise to have a Visa or Mastercard as a backup.</p>",

I really feel bad that moment because they didn't care about situation without the proper information they took an improper action. I talked to customer care about my situation but they just ignore it. I even didn't get a chance to use my point which I have collected for a ages. So, think twice before you apply for account.

So I went inside and they told me that they do not accept the card and I was on \"E\". It's a good thing that I was able to use the \"ATM\" machine and pay the Fees to get cash.<br /><br /><br>Secondly, I went to an establishment and when they saw my card with the American Express Logo they told me they do not accept. I stood in line 10 minutes to get rejected.<br /><br /><br>Also, I do not like the fact that I have a PIN but I cannot get cash back at a grocery store when I buy groceries.<br /><br /><br>Lastly, finding an ATM that offers withdrawals is a hassle. Walmart is the SLOGAN behind Bluebird and where I live the machine is ALWAYS out of order. It has NEVER worked for me. Therefore, I have to drive 20-25 minutes to use an \"ATM\" that accepts Bluebird - without the fee.<br /><br /><br>Moving forward, I have received good customer service despite the many times I have called and the representatives could not find my account using my email address, SSN, or other pertinent information. However, when I ask for a supervisor they are able to find my account. With this being said, I did get one representative that was VERY reluctant to allow me to speak with a representative.<br /><br /><br>I like Bluebird because I get my payroll check Wednesday night vs Friday. Is it work the issue(s) I am having? Yes it is until I get control of my finances and DOCUMENT when I use ANY card. When you make a purchase, write it down.</p>",

Someone got into my bluebird account, changed my profile and transferred 400 dollars to bluebird and then transferred 478 out of bluebird to some lady named Rebecca fransway. Your only allowed 200 per day to load money on your bluebird but unlimited money going out.  This happened at 11:58 pm and another at 12:01 am. <br /><br>Called the fraud department and they had to send me a voice mail to my phone with a fraud case number. They would not talk to me until I got that case number and called back. I then got the number and called back. They are idiots, the guy gave me the wrong case number.  I rechecked the number again and called back, they kept saying it's the wrong number. She called the guy and got the right number. Meanwhile someone is in my account and stealing money and I'm arguing of a number. Go figure they are in Asia. They took the info right and said don't worry you will get your money back. After 8 days The people in Salt Lake City sent me a email saying they declined my 1278 dollar claim because it was authorized. Case closed !! The lady can't add, I never said 1278 so she submitted it wrong. She even read back to me the amount, it was right. But submitted it wrong to salt lake.  I called tha same number (fraud dept) and they said there is nothing they can do that I have to right a letter.  I wrote a letter, sent certified mail with all my bank account statements proving my case and I have heard nothing from them. That was on 5-7-17 and now it is 5-23-17.  I got screwed. For someone to now my personal info and to change my profile had to be an inside job.  There is no number to call Salt Lake City Utah. I expected a lot more out of American Express. They went on what the lady put in 1278 and it didn't add up. No wonder they declined the claim. Almost done intentionally so they won't investigate it.

The money was deducted from my account but was not dispensed from the atm.  I went inside the bank immediately to let them know and contacted Bluebird from their parking lot to file a dispute claim (at the suggestion of the bank's atm manager).  The bank counted their atm that night and acknowledged that it was, in fact, over in the amount of $300.  They immediately sent the credit back to AMEX to be put back on my card.  Bluebird denied my first dispute claim stating the merchant had provided documentation that shows the money was dispensed.  They don't seem to understand that it was dispensed to THEM to be put back in my account and they HAVE NOT DONE THAT, so they are sitting on my money.  I opened a second dispute claim and now it has been almost a month since this all started and Bluebird claims there has never been any credit issued back to them for my account and that they are still investigating my claim.  On the last set of documents I faxed over yesterday (because they claim they never received the documents I faxed over last week) I let them know that I am fully prepared to file a complaint with the BBB and contact media sources to investigate this issue that appears to be a common one with AMEX, and *gasp* I woke up to a $300 provisional credit to my account, which they stated can be withdrawn if they deem my dispute invalid again.  HOW DOES ANY OF THIS MAKE ANY KIND OF SENSE?!?  I am beyond frustrated and will never touch a Bluebird card again, nor will I EVER recommend it to ANYONE.  The day this all happened I went and opened a TD Bank account. Lesson learned. DO NOT USE BLUEBIRD!!!!!!!!!</p>",

Well.......how do you get money out of your account when you don't have an ATM card? The website proposes a service called RIA, or something, to have money waiting for you at WalMart. However, you need to have your pin number and security code from the back of your card. Since the card has been cancelled, this doesn't work.<br /><br /><br>I called Bluebird customer service and they said I should write a check to myself for cash and take it to WalMart (who underwrites this nonsense). The only way you can write a Bluebird check is to have it 'pre-authorized' for the total amount - meaning it automatically deducts that amount from your account and gives you a verification number to put on the check to ensure that it is going to go through. I did all that. I took it to Walmart and they looked at me like I had two heads. They said, 'we don't cash personal checks here, you need to take this to your bank.' I assured them I JUST spoke with Bluebird customer service and they said Walmart could do it since they're the ones who issue this account. No one there had ever seen a Bluebird check before and they wouldn't take it.<br /><br /><br>Next step, I took it to MY real bank. They said they'd cashi it but it would have to be on hold for a few business days. I didn't like that solution either as it's my money and I need it right now. I called Bluebird Customer service again and they said try a Wells Fargo bank since that's who underwrites our checks. Tried that too and they wouldn't touch it. <br /><br /><br>Bottom line is that Customer Service has no idea what they're talking about and you're totally screwed if you lose your ATM card, as there's no way to get at your own money. The Customer Service Rep kept repeating, 'well sir, if you know someone else who has a BlueBird Account, just transfer money to them.' Hell no! I don't know anyone else with this crappy bank and I certainly wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. <br /><br>To hell with this banking nonsense and stick with the big players.</p>",

May damage your credit history and credit rating when using auto pay!!<br /><br /><br>Have had the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express set up using auto pay each month to make the minimum payment for years. Worked hard to improve my credit to qualify for this card (and like most AMEX customers I care about my credit rating, and credit record). <br /><br /><br>Continued improving financial situation and was ready to improve monthly auto pay to pay off the complete balance each month.<br /><br /><br>Logged in and changed the auto pay settings to pay complete balance and replaced minimum payment (correctly during the same login in about a 3 minute transition) and completed this about 10 days before next payment date.<br /><br /><br>Discovered the new auto payment didn't auto pay and called to ask why. They explained that the AMEX system doesn't pay your upcoming payment, it begins auto pay for 2nd payment.<br /><br /><br>What?!!<br /><br /><br>How is this a service to the type of customer AMEX is looking for? Why is AMEX not doing everything they can to protect the customers who are trying to protect their credit by using auto pay?<br /><br /><br>AMEX told me there\u2019s a notice when setting auto pay that, \u201c you\u2019re next payment will not be automatically payed so you have to manually pay your upcoming payment even though you just authorized auto pay.<br /><br /><br>I\u2019m focused on the type and amount of auto pay I\u2019m setting up, not making a manual payment.<br /><br /><br>How does this serve the customer?! It\u2019s hard to imagine how.  It\u2019s easy to understand how it serves AMEX because they have my $30ish late fee in their pocket which they wouldn\u2019t return to my account because I didn\u2019t make a manual payment while adjusting auto pay.<br /><br /><br>This is a conscious systemic decision that jeopardizes every customer\u2019s credit.</p>",

First, there tons of businesses that just don't accept Amex.  Second, I had a travel website double charge my card for a hotel reservation.  It was their mistake. I contact Serve and they said there was nothing I could do but wait 7 days for the transaction to fall off of my account.  I was stuck traveling with no money in my account and Serve would do nothing about the unauthorized transaction.  I contacted the travel website who then got a Serve representative on the phone to clear it up and they still refused to do anything.  Using this as the account for my travel funds, I was stuck on a trip with no money. This card is worthless, this company is worthless and the customer service agents have zero power, knowledge or incentive to assist customers.  STAY AWAY FROM AMEX SERVE!!!!!!!</p>",

It takes them way too long to take care of fraudulent charges, their customer service is some of the worst I've ever experienced, and in order to get even a slight increase in your credit limit you have to have excellent credit, good is not enough. I have had this card for 2 years, have maintained good credit, doubled my yearly income, and never come close to the limit they have set. I have asked for an increase twice in these 2 years just benefit my credit and every time I have been denied. My other 4 credit cards with other companies (who started me off at a higher limit than this shit company did) have all increased my limit 3 times in these past 2 years without even being asked by me. Once this card is fully paid off, I will no longer be doing any business with American Express.</p>",

The reserve account feature is very convenient (it acts as a savings and it comes with the card account), the mobile website is easy to navigate. I started getting my dd's two weeks after giving my employer the info. There are minimal fees compared to other cards like Netspend. The best feature is the cash back, which is unheard of for a prepaid debit card. I've only had a couple issues. When trying mobile check deposit it said my account wasn't authorized for it, don't know what that's all about. When trying to get cash back at a gas station, the terminal immediately ran the transaction as credit when it usually it asks first if it's credit or debit, this probably happened because some stores recognize amex as only credit, it was only at one location this has happened so far. Some locations do not honor amex, but they are very few.</p>",

Already saved 100$ this year using this card on purchases I was going to make anyway.</p>",

I called to verify if I used my account number and rounting number if i could make thise payments. The sales rep informed me that would be fine.<br /><br /><br>After making the payment i see it had not came out of my account. I call back only to be told i was given false information and now i am going to be charged $30 per transcation for the bounce check the car payment will recieve. Even though all calls are recorded and they can hear the sales rep give me false information all they could do was apologize as if that helps ME THE CONSUMER!!! They pretty much told me now im responsible even though their rep told me i could.<br /><br /><br>As soon as i get my replacement card i am with drawing all my funds and cancelling their service because clearly they do not care for their customers. At least Visa would have handled the situation. My advice is to NEVER EVER go with this company.</p>",

I checked out of the hotel and the hotel assured me the $50.00 would be return to card. After 2 weeks I notice the $50.00 was still on hold. I contacted American Express customer service and was informed they had 30 days to release hold.  I contacted the hotel and was informed they cancelled the hold the day i checked out. Really a 30 day hold for a prepaid card. Once I receive money back. I will be cutting up this card</p>",

Finally found this prepaid card. It works wonders. I've had a balance of 0.01 cents for a few months now because sometimes I don't add cash to it. But with the bank issues this card is a great life and money saver. Would highly recommend this to anyone who has balance issues. Thank you American Express/Walmart! And might I add free savings set aside account omg :)</p>",

So I called and the first agent while verifying my acct hung up on me. I know this because I used the house phone that everyone has hook to their cable accts but never really use haha lol. So I calld back again and the 2nd agent didn't even verify my acct so I know she was talkn off the top of here head that there was no direct deposit on hold are even showing up in the system to come out on my regular pay date which is 122316 to check with my employer to get the transaction ID. My company payroll is always correct and on time. I work for a major company so they have their payroll account very much together. After getn off the phone waiting on my employer to get in at 7:00am to call, miraculously my deposit hits my card  not even 15 mins after getting off the phone. I don't know what happen to day but regardless I dont like being lied to with a company I'm conducting business with especially when it's a company that literally holds your financial lifeline in their hands. I will be getting out while I still can. I tried to give this card a chance regardless of its reviews and personal knowledge of fraud on my sisters account through the Jackson Hewitt card but I'm afraid if I keep this card I will have a real horrific encounter like most.</p>",

After over an hour and a half talking to customer service. I would not recommend this card to my worse enemy. Now to get the money we put on the card before this crap so we can find an alternative that does not lie about what you can and cannot do with the card. So if you don't agree fine but my experience was terrible I would NEVER recommend to anyone. And any customer service explanations after this incident will not fix my opinion of this false advertising and poor service</p>",

Everyone who has complained about this card has complained about customer service, so the 2-star rating really isn't accurate. I have direct deposit set up and get my paycheck 2 days before they hand them out at work (super-convenient.) Because of that, the already measly $1 monthly fee is waived. I can get cash out at any US Bank ATM (super convenient.) Most places that accept credit/debit cards accept AMEX. My only complaint is actually about the Android app - I have yet to be able to deposit a check by taking a picture. That function pretty much just doesn't work. I did A LOT of research before getting this card, and it really IS the best prepaid card available. It is unfortunate that a few people have had negative experiences with customer service, but don't let that dissuade you from getting this if you're in need of a prepaid credit card...</p>",

I called cause it was on my card n when i asked the merchant i was told it takes 5-7 for them to send it back. Even tho it took 5 seconds for them to charge me. Its not the card ots the store. 2Years with this card so far so good</p>",

After many holds, the rep said, \"Yes, we made an error.\"  Really? You're American Express?  Isn't this what you're building your business on -- CASH BACK? Isn't it kind of essential you know how to do that? So the guy apologizes and basically says \"We'll be fixing it at some point in the future.\" No other correspondence from them.  Scheez.

I tried to book a hotel room on a third party website. They took almost $200 from my Serve account but did not give me a room. I called Serve customer service and was informed that the funds would appear on my account immediately as soon as the vendor release them but they have up to 7 days to release them and then without medical experiments but 100% of those on the vendor. I called customer service for the online company and they were very Cooperative they apologized and informed me that they never took the funds they just pre-authorized for the amount of the hotel room. However if the money was still appearing as taken from my account they offered to call serve with me on the line and inform them of the error and inform Serve that they will not be taking the money. When we reached the supervisor at the surf customer service she was rude and refused to help in any way just simply saying a phone call was not sufficient that another form of communication was necessary no matter what form of communication the third party online company offered the woman that serve refused. Eventually I had to get off the phone because I needed to get back to my son. I tried calling again over and over speaking to supervisors and always that continue to blame the vendor and in some cases blame me. Serve customer service hung up on me yelled at me and accused me of using profanity when I mentioned that I'd worked in banking for 9 years. The whole experience has just been appalling. Instead of being of the focus on my sick son I'm on the phone with heartless soulless robots. I am cancelling the card as soon as all the money is released. They are holding more funds but I dont really need to go into those because the process was the same. Eventually after numerous calls to Serve customer service in speaking to supervisors one simply told me they didn't care what I needed and what the manager said that with American Express was going to hold my money.</p>",

There are various perks to using it such as percentage cash back, various amounts of credit to online or in store purchases, airline and hotel perks and more. The thing I liked the most about the Amex card is when someone somehow used my card information on two online purchases, and I contacted them about it, they investigated immediately. The first charge of around $30 was reversed within the day. The second charge of over $400 was reversed after an investigation but it took a while longer. They did not contact me after the resolution about who did it, but they did contact me about how the charges were reversed. I think that I would have liked to know how and who stole my card info so I could prevent this in the future. Regardless, I would recommend the card wholeheartedly. The customer service was great and they stand behind their cardholders when something goes wrong.</p>",

The rewards system is based on points, instead of cash back, and you have to make a ton of purchases per billing period to be eligible for any of the special bonuses, otherwise you accrue points at a snail's pace. Points themselves can only be redeemed for specific things too like flights or hotels. The interest rate on this card is pretty high compared to many other cards available and the customer service at American Express is lacking to say the least. When I called with some questions about my statement once, it took me over 30 minutes to get the information I was looking for because I waited on hold and had to talk to three different people.

        "content": "<p>I got the Blue Cash card about 3 years ago because I wanted a rewards card that was easy to use for everyday purchases. I decided on the blue card because of the 3% cash back on supermarkets and 2% on gas because those two categories are the ones I tend to spend the most on. I have found that the card is very easy to use, especially because there are no rotating categories and you know you are getting cash as a reward and not redeemable points. I really like that there is no annual fee and I think the APR is pretty standard for rewards cards. I have had no issues with customer service so far. I would definitely recommend this card to anybody looking for an easy to use cash back card.</p>",

The reason I went for this card in particular was because I wanted something that gave good rewards. So far the only complaint I have is the interface on the website; I've heard from others that it's very intuitive and easy to follow, but I personally found it difficult to navigate and unintuitive. However, that may just be my opinion. I have had no interactions with customer service so I cannot comment on them, but I would recommend this card regardless.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The American Express Green Card was actually the first credit card I was granted. My AMEX Green Card was issued to me in July of 1976, right after I signed my second enlistment in the Air Force. Back then American Express approved all career military personnel, with no negative credit, for a Green Card. I used it exclusively for travel and expenses that were being reimbursed to me by the government, and family emergency travel. In the 39 years I've had my Green Card, I also have a AMEX Gold Card, I can honestly say that I have never had any issues with American Express. Anytime that I called with a question or problem it was promptly addressed. When I was TDY and needed additional spending limit approved it was approved on the spot. When I needed travel assistance it was available, and remember this was before Smartphones and the Internet! I recommend the American Express Green card for anyone who needs a flexible spending limit and wants the ability to get real assistance for any card related issue (travel, purchases, product insurance, etc.), anytime you need it!</p>",

This card gives you access to AMEX Membership Rewards, points that can be cashed in for flights, hotels, gift cards, Amazon purchases, among countless other things. You also gain access to additional protection from AMEX, such as an extended return policy, purchase protection, extended warranty, among other perks. Overall, I love the card, I just wish the fee was a little lower than $195. Fantastic perks and rewards, fee could be lower.</p>",

The one thing I would change is that it looks kind of cheap - the clear plastic just doesn't look 'classy' to me.  But this isn't a big deal at all.  I would highly recommend this card to anyone.

I applied randomly when I got a pop up ad on the Delta site while booking a trip. I love that the interest rate was not too high for someone with average credit like myself. The best part of this card is the free checked bag and the priority boarding on Delta! Amex is a little stingy when it comes to credit line increases so I am disappointed with that as I was given a rather low credit line while other cards I have applied for since have given me much higher limits. I do think the $95 annual fee is on the high side but I have saved enough money with free checked bags to make it worthwhile. The initial 30,000 bonus points were awesome and I was able to book a hotel for a weekend in Miami and still have 10,000 leftover. All in all I am very happy with this card.</p>",

I would definitely recommend this card to anyone who steadily buys a lot of groceries...so basically anyone who shops and doesn't exclusively eat out. This card does have an annual fee of $75, and I would normally never go for a cc with an annual fee, but the grocery savings more than make up for it during the course of a year. The customer service is pretty good with Amex. They've been kind and courteous and even waived some fees for me in the past. Overall this card is an excellent choice is you've got good credit.</p>",

I will qualify that statement by saying I have had issues with them, mainly with the \"transaction hold\" which feels like a hostage negotiation, but otherwise I challenge folks to find a prepaid card with such low fees. My payroll deposits are always available in a timely fashion, or early, there are free ATMs available and not just at Wal-Mart, you can write checks, and I have started to use the bill paying feature which has been terrific so far. For people like me who can't open a standard checking account at the moment this card has been pretty good.

What they don't tell you is that they use a vendor to evaluate whether or not to accept the check. They check I deposited was rejected and even after speaking to a vendor rep I have no idea why. The information is proprietary and they won't tell you why a check was not accepted. They do not provide guidelines of any sort, which means any check can be rejected for any reason. Their excuse is that it is an ap and we shouldn't expect every check to be accepted. The problem is that the Bluebird website and the ap do not give any indication that the check will be put through this arbitrary process. It is time for me to look for another card.</p>",

I currently live in PA, on a trip to Disney for 6days midway through I receive an email saying my card is suspended. I didn't think this was a big deal because I was using my card in Florida.  I get on with a Rep and they tell me my card is shut down.  It is impossible for me to get any money.  So I'm in Disney World with no money.  I thought this was a joke.  After hours and hours of fighting with them I have up.  Also my direct deposit got rejected bc of the closed account.  There was no warning,  no phone call,  no anything.  They said my account was high risk. Mind you I make decent money and I'm about to get a real bank account.  This card left me stranded in Fl and didn't help at all.  They also hung up on me several times. I'll answer any questions.  Please use a different card. Oh they will be sending my funds in the mail 5-7 business days.</p>",

I just got my first statement and I was surprised to see I already got almost 30 dollars back in cash rewards mostly from the 6 percent back on grocery store purchases. I also already got my $150 dollar credit for spending $1,000 in the first three months. . Zero percent interest for the first 15 months is a great help too. That is allowing me to pay off my other credit cards faster that do have interest charges. Three percent back on gas and one percent on everything else plus all the other perks make this a great card all around. As others have warned, the grocery rebate does not include big box stores like Costco. For Costco I use another Amex card that has rewards specific to that store.</p>",

For the second time in as many months I am sitting on the phone for hours with foreign based customer support most of whom barely speak English and constantly repeat themselves as if they are reading from a script.  I have asked for a supervisor and get hung up multiple times after waiting 10 to 20 additional minutes.  Once this latest issue is resolved I WILL NEVER put another dime on this card, you can't trust them.  This most recent time I attempted to take $400.00 out of an ATM the bank denied it saying \"$400.00 EXCEEDS CARD CASH WITHDRAWAL LIMIT\"  I thought this was strange (the daily cash withdrawal limit is $750 on the card, but apparently the ATM had a $400 limit).  I immediately tried again for $300.00, this time it went through with no problem.  Although the ATM never dispersed the money, the $400.00 was deducted from my balance.  I immediately called AE and was told that it would take up to 10 days to even start the dispute process and it could take up to 45 days for it to be completely resolved.  I've NEVER had any kind of issue like this with any other bank or card.  I'm moving this weekend for a new job in a new city and that money is needed, NOW!  The last time was an issue with Macy's pre-authorizing the card twice right at Christmas time for $150.00, Macy's bent over backwards trying to resolve the issue with Amex Serve yet to no avail it took a full 10 days for the money to be released from the erroneous hold, even though Macy's released it immediately.  This card is trash and holding onto individuals money impacts their lives.  I'll be contacting the BBB and banking authorities regarding them.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Beware!!! Absolutely atrocious customer service.  I applied for and received my card in October of 2015.  I specifically chose this card for the travel benefits and sign up bonus miles.  Upon my first flight, on January 6th, I did not receive the priority boarding benefit.  Upon further investigation, I also discovered that not a single mile had been added to my sky miles account.  The obvious answer was to call customer service and have them rectify the oversight.  After more than a month, hours and hours of my time, dozens of customer service reps, and nearly a dozen supervisors, I have yet to receive a single mile!  In fact, when I finally spoke to someone who expressed a genuine concern, my relief was short lived.  Charlotte, at extension 57169, assured me that she would have it all resolved in a matter of two or three days at the latest and that if I had any additional questions or concerns, I should feel free to call her directly.  When I inquired as to which number I should use, she stated to use the number on the back of the card.  Unfortunately, upon calling the number, I would continue to be disappointed after I was told by the operator that they had no way of transferring to extension numbers.  This begs the question of why give it to me in the first place if this is the case???  This conversation took place nearly three weeks ago and still, not a single mile credited to my Skymiles account, nor reflected in my American Express account.  The latest update in this case, is being told by another \"supervisor\" that it may take up to 6-8 weeks before they rectify the account.  Keep in mind that Charlotte stated it would be 2-3 days.  When I asked to speak to his supervisor, he stated that he did not have one and that there was no one I could speak to above him.  <br /><br /><br>So, where does this leave me?  Firstly, I seriously doubt that the account will ever be corrected, even if given 6-8 months!  In addition, nobody has given me an explanation as to why they have the account in error in the first place.  I'm sorry, but I just can not fathom how a major corporation even begins to stay in business by treating their customers in such a manner.  In addition, I have been promised returned phone calls on three occasions.  it should be no surprise that, for more than a month, I have received not a single email, nor a single promised returned call.  At this point, I will be canceling my useless card, AND shorting American Express stock, as such incompetent management will surely lead to the demise of what was once a reputable company.  Do not waste your time!!!</p>",

Unlike other prepaid debit cards however, you don't pay monthly fees. Another thing, if you don't know by now not to use a debit card at the pump you need to cut up every card you own and just stick with cash. You ALWAYS pay inside with a debit card/prepaid card. As far as your tax refund, that is not Amex fault the government didn't push yours through fast enough. As soon as the funds are posted, they recieve them. I get my pay checks a full day earlier thanks to this card because as soon as payroll posts it, the funds are put into my account.  This is an amazing card as far as prepaid cards are concerned.</p>",

Well, American Express would not let me add from my bank account to the card without \"verifying an alert\" they had on my bank account.  The first customer service rep hung up on me after I had waded through their automated system for 15 minutes.  I wrote it off to a mistake, then called again.  I finally told them I would just add cash, that I wouldn't tie it to my bank account and they said I couldn't do that either.  I was so frustrated.  I was getting a customer service rep with \" witty \" canned scripted answers and it was very unsatisfactory.  To top  it all off, I get an email that night saying that I had \"broken the terms of my agreement\" with them so my card was suspended.  Not the customer service experience I had hoped for.  I will never go with American Express, and I will tell this story to anyone who will listen to me.   I just wanted to to have a conversation to figure out what to do, but I guess they are more interested in monologues than dialogues with their customers.</p>",

        "content": "<p>BE WARNED WITH THIS CARD if you like or need to use cash, ever, this is not the card for you. You CANNOT get cash back with this card. Period. Not $20 back at the grocery store, nothing. And if you like the added security of needing a pin for your debit card that's another feature this card doesn't have, it only asks for your pin if you're using it at an ATM($2.50 per transaction+whatever the ATM charges, usually another $3-4). Everything else goes through as instant approval like credit, only without credit's extra security of a signature. If you like paying $6 to get at your own money and the security that comes with knowing any Joe shmoe can swipe your card no questions asked than this might just be the card for you! Also about half the times I try using online features you can't log in due to \"technical difficulties\", some transactions take a LONG time to show up unlike most debit cards where it shows up instantaneously, and there are NO automatic text alerts (which I think is by far the most useful tool to track spending). I would highly recommend the prepaid vision card, that's definitely the best one out there, or the netspend card over this one. Vision comes with easy bill pay, text alerts, roadside assistance, 3% cash back at gas stations, and savings account with 5.65% apy. Close runner up is the netspend card. Also has a savings account and text alerts. If you're a saver this one is great, it pays 5% apy up to your first $5,000. I'd recommend just about any card over the one debit card that won't give you cash back, but those two are the best on the market in my experience. Also, I've noticed no matter how many awful reviews this card has so many websites are still saying it's \"great!\" Yeah, right. Amex sure has their marketing budget on point! If the card was half as good as they say they wouldn't need to pay websites to get the word out, people would just recommend it. Which I would not. To anyone.</p>",

NOT OK!! no one knows my pin but me, and i never made those transactions. it was a total of 168 dollars that i lost. Now i after receiving that email I had received a balance email saying that my balance in my account is 0.00 dollars which is really odd  considering i had almost 1000 on my card the night before. I called the customer support number and the 1st agent was nice and then he hung up on me. I called in a second time and the agent  was very nice, she stated that 2 check withdrawals equaling out to my total was removed from my account, not sure how that was possible when they had disabled my card and I couldn't use it. The second agent had transferred me to another specialist agent and that agent had told me that they had sent me 2 checks with my money on it. I don't understand why they just couldn't send me a new card. After experiencing the worst customer service today I will no longer be using bluebird american express for anything. I originally got it to use my Walmart savings catcher money but now i think i will do something else. WORST WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! <br /><br /><br>**NOTE** BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR CARD. THE MOMENT YOU SUBMIT FRAUDULENT CLAIMS ON YOUR CARD, AMEX BLUEBIRD WILL DISABLE YOUR CARD AND WONT SEND YOU A NEW ONE THEY WILL ONLY SEND YOUR MONEY BY CHECKS. SO I HOPE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THEIR CUSTOMER AFTER THAT. <br /><br /><br>BLUEBIRD AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. AFTER TODAY I WILL FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM.

There have been several occasions where I have used my Serve Card, only to have American Express refuse to release a hold on my funds that were due back to me, for FIFTEEN DAYS, long after the merchant had released the hold. <br /><br>1) I was travelling out of state and I used my Serve Card at the gas pump to purchase $25 of gas. The next day I contacted AMEX to inform them that a $100 hold had been placed on my card for the $25 gas purchased. AMEX instructed me to contact the merchant and request they release the $100 hold. The merchant informed me that the $100 hold had been released. When I shared with AMEX that the merchant had released the hold, AMEX then told me, they have a FIFTEEN DAY HOLD POLICY and while the merchant had released MY funds back to my card, AMEX refused to return my funds to me for FIFTEEN DAYS! <br /><br>2) I had a similar experience while using my Serve Card at a major hotel chain. Used my Serve Card to pay for hotel stay, after checking out I notice a deposit hold on my SERVE Card. Once again I contacted the hotel about the hold and I was informed that the hold had been released by the hotel, and AGAIN, AMEX refused to release the hold for FIFTEEN DAYS!<br /><br>3) I used my SERVE CARD while renting a car from a major national brand. Upon walking to my rental vehicle I noticed the rental car company had made a mistake and charged me a higher rate for my rental. The rental car company promptly voided that transaction and corrected the error. However, AMEX refused to release the incorrect amount for FIFTEEN DAYS. I ended up paying for two rentals and not having my $250 returned to me for FIFTEEN DAYS! I'm done, I cut my SERVE CARD in half. No other debit cards or credit cards place FIFTEEN DAY HOLDS on your funds. BEWARE!!!!</p>",

But after the promotion was over, I found myself loving this card.  There is no fee to reload the card and I can reload the card with a machine at Walmart. That was very easy.  The card is pretty convenient, when I have money loaded on it, I can use it a lot of places, but I did run into at least one store that didn't take American Express so that was inconvenient.  It was very easy to apply online for the card and I got it within two weeks or so.  I love that it has the option for you to set up sub accounts. You can set up a savings account and move money from the main account to it and you have to transfer it back to the main account to spend it so that can potentially help you save money better. You can set up subaccounts for other family members as well. Customer service was pretty friendly and helpful but it was a little frustrating when I called because I had made a purchase online and something happened so that it didn't go through (computer error or something) and  the money was transferred but it didn't go through on the retailer's side and it took several days for it to get transferred back over to Bluebird.  Finally, I use Bluebird to get paid for online crowdsourcing work and I get the money pretty quickly, at least by the next day.</p>",

This is a much better option than some checking accounts out there, for sure.  A good card with a great company.  I recommend.</p>",

I got it primarily to use for transferring some money I make from working online, but since getting it, I find that I use it for so much more! Transferring money via my Bluebird is so fast and easy. Transfers go through within minutes. My deposits are handled smoothly and quickly. I use their app to find compatible ATMs, so there's no fee for withdrawals, but on the few occasions that I've not been able to locate one, the fee is comparable to my regular bank account.</p>",

The ATM fee is relatively low compared to other prepaid cards that I've used in the past. Overall, I feel that Bluebird is a perfect card for those with or without a bank account. This card would also be ideal for college students! Parents can easily load the card with money every month for their kids away at college, and it gives them an opportunity to learn about budgeting their money.</p>",

They can't even spell, ferchrissake. Bluebird isn't a debit card and shouldn't be used like one. Don't use it at the gas station, don't use it at hotels and don't assume all merchants accept AmEx. Instead, hit the ATM on your way out and avoid the embarrassment. They keep whining and moaning about how crappy it is. AmEx ain't stupid. They'll catch onto your scheming ways quick so don't try it. Use the card as you're instructed in the welcome packet and it'll but nothing but a breeze.</p>",

Bought an American Express Serve card at OfficeMax where it was marketed with all of the other Reloadable General Use Cards and Gift Cards.   Getting back home, I notice that the that card cannot be effectively used without registering it at their website.  Ok, fine.  PITA, but get it done.  Go to the website but our firewall and spyware checker blocks the site.  That seemed odd, AmEx is supposed to be a reputable company.  Do some checking.  Yes, the Serve.com does put spyware on your computer from marinsm.com.  Not good, call the 800 number on the card to register via phone hoping to avoid the spyware.  They say the only way to register the card is through the website ( yes, the one with the spyware).   Grumble.  Ok, visit a library to use a public computer (the library wipes away all of the bad stuff after every use).  Go to register the card only to find out you MUST give them ALL of your personal information including uploading a scan of your personal ID with PHOTO. Umm, NO!  All I wanted was a reloadable card for Christmas so the SO doesn't see how much and where I spent on her.  Thought I would try the AmEx card just to try their service.  One really bad experience.  Not sure how I get my money back now.  I don't want to use the card afraid that even  using it to get the money off the card will obligate me to some term or condition that I don't know about.</p>",

The Green Card frankly isn't a great card, but it does get you in the door with Amex. You get 1 bonus point for each dollar of spend which roughly translates to 1% back but it depends on how you redeem it. The annual fee of $39 is expensive for a card without great benefits but hopefully after responsible use you will be able to get one of the better cards offered by Amex.</p>",

I explained to the rep why I wanted the increase and I had no need for the card unless my request was met and he simply said OK we can cancel your card. I have been with  DISCOVER for 2 years now and have been so pleased with Discover. They are top notch. I am sorry Discover for trying to cheat on you . I will stay with them. I recommend that you apply with Discover the interest rate is lower and the customer service is OUTSTANDING! To bad AMEX you lost what was going to be a great customer. By the way I have a 14,000 credit limit with Discover and an interest rate of 11.99% which AMEX couldn't even come close . Plus Cash rewards are applied every month you don't have to wait for them.</p>",

I understand it's not a credit card but I'd rather have something like a Chase Freedom card or any of the other credit cards that don't charge interest for a year instead of a charge card. I think the annual fee is excessive. No fee is always better. I don't travel or have little opportunity to use rewards points so it's pointless. Considering it's a charge card that you must pay at the end of every month, it may be easy to get into trouble and have to pay a late fee. That would be very worrying in my situation, I'd rather have the safety net of a credit card and have to only pay the minimum.</p>",

If I expressed my annoyance he kept saying one line. He looked at my documents and claimed the bank logo wasn't visible. I just looked at it again and its fine. Itsan restatement in a PDF from my banka website. He told me to print i, take a picture and upload that.

        "content": "<p>Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae from American Express has a great offer to get those to sign up for the card.  The 0% APR is usually offered for 12 months for purchases and cash transfers but Blue Cash Preferred is offering the promotion for 15 months.  Also, another great feature is the automatic enrollment in earning cash back.  I had that feature with one of my credit cards and it only allowed you to use the cash back with services and/or products that the credit card company offered.  With this card, the cash back is offered as Reward Dollars that can be applied directly to statement.  One negative is the variable rate of the regular APR.  It can fluctuate between 12.99% to 21.99% that depends on a variety of factors.  Also, I prefer cards with no annual fees as the $75 is a moderate fee.  Overall, a great card and a chip will be a huge benefit for when traveling abroad.</p>",

Is there any way I can reload it at Sheetz or Rite aid or at a local bank even if I don't have a bank account with them? I really need to order something offline for my Jewelry in candles business but I can't find a ride to Walmart to reload my card. Is there any other place that I can reload it?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I like that my fee is waived due to direct depisit, but that is where it ends. Until about a week ago there were no \"in network\" atm's in my area, so I either had to withdraw large amounts of cash at one time to try to cover any needs and avoid losing money to multiple fees or just pay up to five dollars for each withdrawal. Now there are supposed to be network atm's, but I was just charged three dollars at one a few days ago. Besides every merchant not accepting AMEX, my card is repeatedly declined at different places even when there is more than enough to cover my purchase on the card. Making purchases online is a nightmare due to the two different codes on the card and you have to decide by process of elimination which one is valid for the transaction. Yes, you can receive your paycheck early, but every pay cycle will be a crap shoot as to when your funds are loaded. I have received my dd as late as on the payday, early afternoon to as early as five days prior to payday. Basically, the card is only good to minimize check cashing fees for people like myself who are done with the crooked banking system. If you want to be embarrassed and frustrated, get this card.</p>",

The initial bonus of 40,000 bonus points is a great feature when you consider how many nights you may be able to book for free with just those points alone.  The regular point values seem to be reasonable as well, which means that this card would probably pay for itself on hotel rooms alone.  However, I find that for a card such as this, the interest rate appears to be rather high.  Also, be charged both a cash advance rate and a cash advance fee is a little over the top.  I would be afraid of ever needing that service with those kinds of fees attached.  Overall, if you are someone who travels a lot and uses their credit card quite frequently, this would be a good one for you based on rewards alone.</p>",

Amex Blue Cash offers a lower interest rate at 12.99-21.99%, Blue Sky offers an interest rate of 17.24-22.24%  That's a big spread on the low end and that will add up quickly over time.  The $38 late fee is above Cap One's Silver, which offers $35.   On the plus side, there's no annual fee, but that's available with many cards.  Additionally, there's the prestige of Amex, which is highly regarded.  This would not be my first choice, but it seems like a decent card.</p>",

The first year, they waive the annual fee but it rises to $160 after the first year, which is probably the only negative aspect of this card as this fee rests in the upper spectrum of annual fees with any credit card out there. Personally, I would still prefer regular credit cards that allows me the flexibility to pay in full each month or just the minimum if my funds for the month run low. Other cards like Chase Freedom and BankAmericard offer this flexibility while maintaining many of the cash-back options seen in this card. But then again, if you are a frequent traveler, the Gold Card is an appropriate card for you.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've had this card for a few years now because a friend recommended the card. Bluebird has never failed me!!!!!<br /><br>Why'd I give it 5 stars? The pros outweigh the con's! I have minor issues, but overall, I LOVE my card!!!<br /><br /><br>Pros:<br /><br>- You are not charged to replace a card.<br /><br>- No bounced checks: It will allow you to write checks for only the amount you have in your account.<br /><br>- Set aside accounts (I use these accounts for saving). You can transfer money between accounts without a fee!<br /><br>- Sub accounts: Allows you to add additional cards to your account for your children.<br /><br>- Bill pay<br /><br>- Direct deposit. You will not be charged an ATM fee for withdrawals at their ATM's. <br /><br>- You are able to transfer, unlimited times, money to and from your sub accounts and set aside accounts without a few.<br /><br>- You're able to pay anyone, anywhere.<br /><br>- Walmart is open 24 hours. I am able to upload money, anytime via a cash register.<br /><br>- Lost or stolen card, your money is protected, FDIC insured.<br /><br>- There is no fee associated with this card!<br /><br /><br>Con's:<br /><br>- You can only withdraw a certain amount daily. A couple of times, I needed more money! Its not like a bank where you'd be able to withdraw money for unexpected incidents! <br /><br>- The MoneyPass ATM in Walmart is ALWAYS out of order. Luckily, there is a WAWA that doesn't charge a service fee. Bluebird doesn't have control if the money machine!<br /><br>- Without direct deposit, you are charged an ATM fee.<br /><br>- A lot of merchants do not accept American Express.<br /><br>- I've had issues using their check cashing service. I was unable to load checks to be processed, I discontinued using this service.<br /><br>- Customer Service is outside the US!!!!<br /><br /><br>Bluebird is an alternative to banking, it is NOT a bank!</p>",

Everything was fine until we tried to have my pell grant refund deposited on it. They rejected it!! They can't even tell me why except it's not a gov't refund. Really?! We were really counting on the money!! Then you have to wait days to have it rejected sent back to the school etc. I've read similar reviews where people have had similar problems with their payroll checks. Can you imagine not getting paid?!  Then if you go read all of the small print they say they have the right to reject any deposit. Ok fine but  federal pell grant money and pay roll checks really?! We used to like this card until we actually starting using the direct deposit feature which is a joke. This card is no longer in use and never will be again. As for the customer service, Ha these people are rude and you can barely understand them. They repeat the same thing over and over while you are just desperately trying to figure out where your money is. This place lost my respect as well as my business</p>",

I guess the biggest difference between this and other cards I have are how the cash is put back to your statement. I do like how my Southwest Card I can put it towards other things besides air travel. It is handy to have that flexibility. But overall the Blue Cash Everyday Card has a very competitive interest rate and no annual fee which is huge! And who couldn't use the $100 bonus?</p>",

I gladly would have given negative stars for the bullshit I've had to endure.I have had Nothing but problems trying to get money off of it, even at Walmart where I'm supposed to get free cash withdrawals,no such luck! I had to use a regular atm where I paid the atm fee and another $2.50 from American express,because it wasn't a money pass atm.  I paid $5 to get MY money out and twice I've had a merchant screw up and cancel my transaction only to not be able to use the card because the money gets put on hold for 3 to 5 days.and when your on vacation fill your car up and they do it YOUR screwed because that money is not available then,but you have gas and you can't pay for it.so thank you blue bird for ruining what should have been a great weekend(my baby brothers wedding)I almost forgot these problems only happen AFTER you've gone from store to store to store to find someone who will even take this peice of s@$! Card. Don't do it it's worth $5 dollars a month to get a visa preload able card everyone takes visa and if a transaction is voided it's like it never happened you can still spend your money because you should be able to only crappie ass bluebird wants to make you homicidal.</p>",

I got my card in the time they estimated, and decided to try and load money online to see if it went smooth. Boom.... instant cash on my acct from my other bank. CVS now offers 0 fee for loading your card which is another bonus. I have had this card for about 4 months now and I have not had any major issues. I had a mini issue on Davids Bridal, tried to get something I didn't have enough $ so they charged me 3x for a dollar each time, called customer service the woman spoke clear english was polite no problems. I would have given this 5 stars except I am a little hesitant depositing my payroll check to this card, and I am a little bummed that paper checks take so long to process (6-10 business days) if you try to deposit them on your phone app. Other than those two things, I have not had any issues, I love the fact that there is 0 fees each month for me, and 0 fee for loading your card, where my other card charged you 4.95 to load, and 5.00 a month fee.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Although the $450 fee is high the benefits outweigh it, even if you are not a big spender. Figure $100 of the $200 airline benefits, 3 trips to the Centurion club in NY SF Dallas or LV is worth $150, $20 for TSA Precheck means it costs $180 a year still a lot. BUT you also get Hertz and Avis and SPG gold membership and no expiration date on miles with a 20% mile refund when you use the miles directly instead of transferring them to an airline program. That has a hard-to-measure value. And if you eve take an upscale cruise  on one of several cruise lines Amextravel counselors may only be average but you will definitely save money by getting cabin upgrades and free perks.When there is an error on the bill they really check it for you, and the one time I had a $500 Dollar rentacar damage charge they picked it up. Great customer service in general. No international exchange fees is nice but not unique. I have another card for groceries and gas, but I use Amex Platinum for everything else (except when I go to a local merchant who I do not want to let know I have such a prestigious expensive card) Now if you use the bigshot rewards like the special deals at top tier hotels, or the 2 for 1 first class plane tix it is even more valuable, but I don't and it is still great.</p>",

I made a purchase at a retailer, the transaction was wrong so they voided and rerang it correctly. The first problem is that the transaction was voided and not returned. Don't EVER let anyone void transactions - it becomes a huge nightmare. The voided transaction was for $111.67, the new transaction for $95.24. The merchant told me the $111.67 would go back to my card within 24 hours. Well, it's day 5, and I still don't have my money. I have called Bluebird 4 times, and the answer I got today was that they eliminated their pre-authorization department and no longer allow merchants to submit info to have a pre-authorization (or hold) removed. I MIGHT get my money back after 8 days. I am so angry I could spit. I will be finding another account to do my banking with. This has been a horrible experience.</p>",

In these times, who really has an excellent credit scores. Makes it harder for your average person to be able to obtain this card. However, with that said, I do like the no annual fee. I have received several offers which require $75 to $125 annual fees. Ridiculous to pay money to have a plastic card. Rewards to earn seems pretty standard and a nice perk. The new over limit fee is another nice option as well as the smart chip for extra protection and in this age of fraud this is a very nice feature. Overall, seems like a really nice card, just maybe not as obtainable for everyone.</p>",

This is a great charge card, for travel and booking my hotels, rental cars and flights, through AMEXTRAVEL and enjoy double points, with no blackout dates Guaranteed. Just what I wanted for many years, finally came through. Thank you AMEX! Also Fraud protected to the penny! No Bank Debit card needed for the use of your checking account.

Contacting customer service is IMPOSSIBLE since customer service does not exist with Serve unless you are checking your balance or doing anything that DOES NOT requires human interaction.

She would have been better off with $1000 in McDonald's Gift Certificates. They have a maximum deposit of $200 dollars a day but they allow, daily transfers.  I set up dailies so that my daughter would have $1000 dollars available on the day she arrived in Spain.  I had her use the card at the airport in the USA before boarding the plane.  It worked.  Off you go!<br /><br>She used the card in Spain at an ATM and the bank machine  took the card.  Fortunately the bank was open and she went in to the bank and retrieved the card.  Afraid to use the card, she contacted me.  I contacted American Express Serve. I was told that I needed to download documents and send to Serve electronically.  Nothing was wrong with the account that i was transferring the funds from.  Why had the first $400.00 been successfully transferred? No one from the India call center could answer that question.  Documents uploaded, downloaded and sent with the help of an professional IT guy here helping me (the Amex Serve Web Site sucks) according to the IT guy.  Three hours and 5 or 6 customer service representatives later I am told we are all set.  I asked, \"will the previously scheduled  3 transfers of $200 be retroactive\"? I was told \"yes\". Well NO they were not.   Back on line setting up transfers first $200 go into serve account and I get an email saying there is a problem with my account.  I call the customer service help line, two more hours and 3 customer service  reps later, I decided to just fly over to Spain and deliver the money to my daughter myself.  Even if I get strip searched at TSA it won't be as painful as my call center experience.</p>",

With this card before I started a direct deposit on it my monthly fee was still waived. I don't trust any prepaid with my total paycheck, so I don't have those problems. <br /><br>I was thinking about using this card to book my hotel, but after reading some of these horror stories, i'll stick to using my bank account. <br /><br>I do like that I can transfer money within minutes to this card. I wish I could load money to my PayPal account that fast from my bank account. Not enough people accept AE for my taste. And DONT try to use this card to pay important bills. Other than that, this card is nice..</p>",

If you spend a lot on the card and pay the balance off every month, though, I'm sure you can redeem faster. All in all, not the best card out there, but better than most.</p>",

I'm pretty sure my credit or bank account is not big enough to be able to get one of these but it's good to have dreams and goals.  I want to be able one day to go into a BMW dealership and just take a test drive get back to the dealership and slap one of these golden pieces of plastic down.  On a serious note,  I love love love the travel benefits, purchase protection, and the return protection....I guarantee each one of these services are top notch.  I took a look at the annual fee and did a double take but you gotta figure, if your able to get one of these 125 after the first year is more than likely chump change.  I feel the annual fee is worth it to just have the piece of mind that in your wallet you've got a gold american express.  Compared to my credit card,  it blows it away in every category.  That's just the way life is,  and that's why I love america.....it makes you wanna do better for yourself, strive for something better.  You better believe,  I will be making strides so that one day, I'll possess this beautiful gold american express !!</p>",

I HAVE NOT received a Federal Tax Deposit this year.  When I called the customer service department, which is not in the US, I was told that no I had not received a Fed Tax Deposit, but no they would not write a letter for me, since it was not their policy.

So to sum it up - They are not willing to help their customers and they defame them to the IRS.</p>",

This is convenient because of how it keeps your credit great but if something goes awry and you can't pay it there is a big fee to pay. Assuming you have excellent credit to start with this shouldn't be much of a problem though and it keeps the interest from building up. With no preset limits it really opens a lot of doors for its owner. Wouldn't recommend the American Express Green Card to those who love to travel though, get those airplane miles!</p>",

Their customer service is always impeccable and they readily lowered it as I had a great payment history.  I can use their system to set up a monthly payment system and I find it incredibly easy to use.  This card is used for all of my vacations, monthly bills and seems to be accepted by most retailers.

On its own merit, the rewards system is a positive. Although you can earn rewards at a high rate compared to some other cards, I would rather get cash rewards than these point reward systems. The negative aspect is you basically have to use this card all the time to earn enough rewards to cancel out the high fee. Which leaving you breaking even. I much prefer a card with no annual fee so I can keep the rewards and spend them on something I want or need.</p>",

No activation fee, a very low monthly fee (1 dollar a month is pretty good), and you can add cash to it for free at a lot of places. When it works, it works well. However, their customer service department leaves some to be desired.<br /><br /><br>Long wait times and even when you get someone you get the runaround from them. This card is great if you don't have much credit but there's also a lot of other prepaid options out there (Discover has a great customer service team and a very nice prepaid card as well.) It would do well for you to consider your options when looking at this card.</p>",

Accepted everywhere, no foreign fees, and if you're in a pinch the concierge service can be really helpful.<br /><br /><br>The Platinum Card really distinguishes itself from the other big cards with it's convenience, great features, and ease of use. It's even better than the Discover Rewards Card which isn't as ubiquitous abroad and has foreign transaction fees.</p>",

I can't stand them and ace elite is worst I'm switching back to regular checking asap and if you must get a prepaid card get krogers or Walmart they both were awesome but I lost Both cards and never replace them but please listen to me don't get this card if you are a big spender like me and love return things to the store and expecting your money to go back on your card within one to two days or want cash back at the check out lane this ain't the card for you because you can't get cash back even if you use your pin and you can't take out more then 2,000 a month and you can't pay your car note at lest I can't if you really wanna get more then 2,000 out at a time what you could do is have your husband or wife buy a card in their own name and transfer the money two them so that why you can take out 4,000 or what ever you want instead being on a stupid 2,000 limit that ain't nothing they need to be shut down for all the little tricks that they be pulling on keeping people money in their account</p>",

Things we really liked about this card are: the bonus points we got upon sign up, first year membership free and the exceptional customer service and online account management tools from American Express.  They also have plenty of great ways to redeem your points.  In general, the value for each point equates to about a dollar - however, there are some things that seemed more expensive to redeem.  For e.g. if you plan to exchange these points for Starwood SPG points it works about to about 3:1 - which I think is a bit too much.  Also, we are not really happy that they have increased the annual fee this year to $175 - this is a good chunk if you are really small business owner and takes a good chunk out of the points you can potentially earn in an year.</p>",

I especially love the American Express extended warranty, it really helped when our washing machine died just out of manufacturer's warranty. In addition to the extended warranty, you get the excellent american express fraud protection. While I have not had to use it myself, I have had friends who received very prompt warnings from american express when their cards were stolen. This can save you a great deal of hassle. You also get American Express points on travel and groceries! I cannot recommend it enough!</p>",

You have to pay it off each month, so you're not going to get into as much trouble as you could with other cards that let you carry a balance. I love how quickly you can accumulate points, though. I don't love the annual fee, because I tend to not see a benefit to cards that have an annual fee. However if you use a credit card for any and everything, and pay it off at the end of the month, you could be a candidate for this card. I will say that AmEx's customer service is great. When I have had to contact them for a dispute, they've taken care of everything without having to hassle them. Truly exceptional for this industry!</p>",

Also, they don't charge a fee for being over the limit but I don't like that they charge a 2.7% foreign transaction fee since there are so many fees on overseas transactions anyway. I would prefer my card to not add to the list of overseas transaction fees. Also, the cash advance fee is a probably standard but high for my preference. This card seems like it's good for acquiring traveling  points and if you pay on time then you should be okay, otherwise this card has some hefty fees that you may need to review beforehand.</p>",

I got this card when I started out and it let me build up credit so I could make other purchases down the line. The American Express Serve card is a prepaid card though. You have to put up your own money to use on it instead of using a credit line. The upside to this is there's no possibility for overcharging, fees, or any interest accruing. <br /><br /><br>It's an excellent way to start building your credit or to have tucked away just in case. However, it doesn't have much in extra features or any rewards points. Like the Capital One Rewards Card which you can use points on to redeem towards your balance or other things. Still, it's a good card to start out with.</p>",

I have a Barclay card with similar APR, so I pay it off at the end of every month, which offers one point per dollar spent on normal purchases and two points per dollar spent on Groceries, Gas, and Utilities. These points can be redeemed back at a similar rate as the Amex Blue Sky card, but for credits on my credit card bill. <br /><br /><br>So in short if you travel a lot this might be a card for you, but if you do not there are better reward cards out there.</p>",

The points that it offers too, coupled with the offers that Amex allows you to add to The Platinum Card from American Express instantly from your online account allow you an amazing amount of savings.

Granted, you get your 1st yr free, but after that it will cost you. It's a way to make the customer use this card over any other in order to get the rewards and balance out that annual fee. I still prefer my Chase Freedom Card with the 5% cash back categories and NO annual fee. It really does provide a sense of freedom with not having to worry about using it all the time in order to balance out the annual fee.</p>",

There are oodles and oodles of little perks rolled into this little card...and many of them seem to continue to build on each other.  Additionally, the interest rates and fees on this card are very low.  Another feature I like is that if they see charges that don't seem to be right, they'll contact you right away to make sure that they are not, in fact, fraudulent charges.  Overall, if you qualify for this card, I definitely suggest you get it!</p>",

The interest rate is variable but usually pretty good but where this card shines is the reward points and the ability to use those towards travel expenses. If you use your card a lot this can really save you money over time and adds value to the card.<br /><br /><br>Compare to other reward cards where the points are nice but can't be as readily applied to travel expenses. If you're a big traveler this card is perfect for you, otherwise it's still pretty good. Definitely a good credit card.</p>",

If I am being completely honest, I have to bring up all of the places that do not accept this card. Living in a place like New York City, the last thing you want is to be in a line at checkout and then end up holding everyone back while looking for your card to only realize that the establishment does not accept it. For example ,some places that accept Visa but not this card include my local McDonalds, Northface, and H&amp;M. IN addition to these, there are also a lot of local mom and pop stores which would not be fair to include in this review. When I do use it, though, the points I receive back are very reasonable, and banking with it is hassle free, which American Express does a good job at maintaining.</p>",

I also notice that in the terms it says \"Up to\" $200 Airline Fee Credit Annually. I wonder what the typical user of this credit card receives. I also notice that in order to get the statement credit you need to chose one particular airline that you plan to use every time. When I fly I chose the airline that has the best deal I'm not loyal to any one particular airline. I think that the Chase freedom card has a much better reward program. No annual fee, points on all purchase and I can redeem them on any airline I choose.</p>",

I have no problems with Direct Deposit or our Major Payroll company not using Serve.. my first paycheck went on there seamlessly.  The web site tells you where your free ATM's are located so why people are paying ATM fees I don't know.  They also say cash back is free, don't see the issue myself.  I have paid online, over phone, in person with no problems and I have had no debit or credit problems,  this card works perfectly for me.  Thank you American Express!!!!!!!</p>",

Went to the bank Ive been with for over 6 years to help my older \"adopted son\", who came to live with my family, open a simple checking account and was told no because he didnt have a new TX DL with proof he lives here....I dont have him on any bills for proof of address and he doesnt drive yet and it was so frustrating to be told NO to taking his  money....so got the Bluebird card same day...he set it up on phone in car driving him to work (6 min) and when he deposited the cash on the card at WalMart it was loaded within seconds!!! The receipt even puts deposit amount and card balance for convenience. He uses it everyday and just got new official card in mail within 6 days <br /><br>(not 10) and set up was fast and no comments from Bluebird came at him and no issues!! The best part is my younger son can have one too and load all his chore...birthday...and good grades money on it and its in his name and he gets to keep the card in his wallet and I do not have to be present at the counter signing anything! Its not a bank controlled card and the control has been tossed aside and now both my kiddos can learn how to be responsible with money! The only downfall is Im running to Walmart all week and I think I need gas $ direct deposited into my own Blueburd Acct!!! Lol...j/k I love how easy this card is and Im glad there is a limit on usage because it helps save save save!!!!! Thanks Bluebird. And to those of you griping about it....try and look at it in a positive way cause you could always go back to your bank and get charged for everything and only have certain times you can deposit and with Bluebird the money is never on hold! And if you are trying to deposit a personal check on your Bluebird card its a safety net I love them having to prevent fraud and theft. Checks are cash and if you cant show the green then you shoukdnt be writing a personal check...same as if you received one from a client or something else....if they took checks like that and got scammed outta money then the card wouldnt be free fees anymore now would it??? As far as the savings rewards go....check into that a little more. Yall didnt read the fine print.....I think I covered abt 25 msgs and my responses to them so have a great Bluebird Day!!! Chirp...Chirp!</p>",

I travel a lot to foreign countries, and such an additional charge would be burdensome. My Citibank did not have such a charge; but now I'm going to double check current terms to make sure that was not a new condition added.<br /><br>The Amex late fee also seems excessive, and would cause me to not want the card. Due to traveling so much, there are times when I come close to missing the due date (even the grace period).<br /><br>Seems odd that the cash back percentage varies depending upon the type of purchase made. I prefer cards that have a set percentage, regardless of where I shop and what I purchase. The Capital One card that I had was a set percentage on everything.<br /><br>Also, the require to purchase $1000 in the first 3 months, just to get the first $100 back is a negative motivator; trying to get the customer to spend more than they might ordinarily spend is not good.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The American Express prepaid card is a good way to teach older kids and especially college students how to use a credit card without ruining their credit if they mess up and spend too much. This will control their spending by giving them a limit and not allowing them to go over. However, the cost of reloading the card is $3 each time and if you use an ATM there is also an additional $3 charge. Fees can get quite expensive and are a waste of money in some instances. There are other cards available such as at Walmart or through a bank that will be cheaper and still allow parents to teach their children about the value of money and using credit cards. American Express cards are getting harder to use at some places but the businesses are having to pay a fee to American Express each time the business swipes a card so it would be more convenient to have a Visa or MasterCard instead of an American Express.</p>",

You earn points that can be redeemed towards statement credits for airline tickets, hotel stays, and other types of travel. This is perfect for a small family that likes to travel quite a bit. We used to use our Discover card, but it only offered perks that allowed to to buy from their store, which I didn't like.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Great card for my needs though I have a bank account and do not have anything direct deposited to the card. <br /><br /><br>Registration on the BB website was a breeze as was setting up instant transfer of funds from my  bank checking through either the desktop or Android app.  It's also equally easy and very convenient to send $ to a friend's BB card, and all with no transaction fees.  Take that, Green Dot and NetSpend!  <br /><br /><br>My single complaint for my limited uses is that there don't appear to be many MoneyPass ATMs outside of Walmarts in the area, and they rarely seem to be in working order, and according to staff at one store \"It's never working\", but to give credit, that particular one WAS working for the first time in weeks or even months on my last visit.  When withdrawing funds at Non-MoneyPass Atms, the fees are obnoxiously high, but that's no different than with other cards when going off-network.  My limited dealings with heavily accented customer service have been adequate but I've only had questions and no complications to solve. People should take note that a prepaid card is essentially a debit card and as such does not offer the same protections as a credit card.  Losing or having your card stolen is like dropping cash on the ground.  As with someone using your debit card, your money is gone and the bank can investigate for an extended time before (or without) ever compensating you for your loss - and I'm not sure why they should except where either they've been notified that the card should be cancelled and their failure to promptly do so results in additional charges, or their systems get hacked, <br /><br /><br>For my purposes, it's a great card.  Maybe not so much if it's your only banking option.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Platinum Card from American Express may appeal to the high end business user but for most people it won't be worth the money.  The annual fee is a whopping $450.  If your credit is good enough to be approved for the card, you can really do better although the perks may make it worth it for you.<br /><br /><br>With the card you earn 1 point per dollar spent.  You also earn 40,000 points if you spend $3,000 on purchases in your first 3 months.  As it is an Amex the balance must be paid off each month.  There are no foreign transaction fees and they offer a concierge service.  This would be useful for an international business traveler.<br /><br /><br>For comparison sake, I also looked at the Blue Cash Preferred from American Express.  The annual fee on that card is only $75.  The Blue card does allow you to carry a balance and the APR is between 12.99%-21.99%.   With that card you earn between 1 and 6% cashback.  If you spend $1000 in the first three months you get a $150 statement credit.<br /><br /><br>I'd suggest this card for international business travelers with expense accounts.  For users on more of a budget the Blue Cash Preferred or other rewards cards are a much better deal.</p>",

The Direct Deposit option is no good for this (and frankly, it wasn't any good for my employer, who refused to do a Direct Deposit because \"Serve\" is not a \"real bank\" and their direct deposit info is not accepted by most corporations when it comes to payroll).

Even though I had credit cards, I would always say Blue Cash Everyday work in a way towards cash back. Blue Cash Everyday has detailed split up with different type of merchants and each merchant category it has defined rewards percentage, unlike other credit cards broader classifications like Grocery, fuel, drugs. Blue Cash Everyday provides standard rewards points throughout the year irrespective of any seasonal offers, which might not help most of the customers. AMEX Blue Cash Everyday provides 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months which helped me in financial critical situation. The most amazing feature which makes to love this card personally is their customer service, because one fine month, my auto payment stopped because of various issues with my back and accidentally called customer service to check the status and to check my late payment fee, I was really surprised the customer server person was very polite and said \"we will wave the fee, since I had good history with them, this shows they know the value of their customer and more over they know how to respect their customer to grow their business.

The displayed rates may not actually reflect what you're going to get if you apply.  The points program is nothing to crow about either.  You get 1 point per dollar spent and a $100 credit for every 7500 points.  Honestly, go with capital one or another card, this just doesn't do you much good.</p>",

I did the math, and found that I\u2019d have to spend a lot more on groceries to make the annual fee of the Blue Cash Preferred worth it. The interest rate is very high, yes \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t want to carry a balance on most cashback cards anyway. I tend to buy Amazon gift cards at supermarket checkouts anyway, so the 3% back definitely comes in handy.<br /><br /><br>Overall, I couldn\u2019t be happier with my experiences so far.</p>",

However, as someone that is able to keep their spending in check and likes to travel, it might be worth looking at the Hilton HHonors credit card in the future. I like that there are no blackout dates, and no annual fees. The late fee is a little steep, but that shouldn't be a problem if you use the card responsibly. That cash advance rate is also a bit ridiculous, but there's an easy solution to that: Don't use a credit card to pull cash out of an ATM.</p>",

I know you have to pay off your balance every month with American Express, so the people who can do this may not be bothered by the high annual fee.  The points are nice, but I prefer cards that give me cash back. I think this card may be good for a certain demographic, but I'm not in that demographic.  I prefer a low (or no) annual fee and cash back.  I also like the option to not pay my whole balance every month in case I run into financial trouble.</p>",

The late fee isn't bad compared to some of the others out there.  The $100 bonus for $1,000 is something that is great if you are using this card strictly for rewards and paying the credit card off in full.  However with the 15 month no APR, it's not as big of an issue.  It is important to be careful as these deals attract people who love to buy things now and suffer the consequences later.  Another thing to note is any American Express is not taken everywhere like Mastercard or Visa is.  Most small businesses do not take AE, so if you shop local, you may want to avoid this card or AE in general.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I enjoy the Blue Cash Preferred from American Express. If you are a regular shopper with your credit card, earning the $75 annual fee back in terms of rewards can come quite quickly. The 6% back on groceries is an awesome perk for any family. However, you would have to make sure you are shopping at a traditional grocery store rather than a SuperCenter. I like earning 3% at gas stations. Anything that can lower the price at the pump is helpful. The APR between 12.99% and 21.99% is very fair and better than many other credit cards I have researched lately. The current credit card that I utilize does not have an annual fee and I earn 1% back on all my purchases. I do not think it would be a perfect fit for me to change to Amex simply because my spending would not counteract the $75 annual fee but for people that have large families or spend a great deal on groceries and gas, it could add up quickly!</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Blue Sky from American Express card is not my favorite card due to its bonus points program. It has becoming increasingly standard for credit cards to offer some sort of sign-up bonus. This card does not. Nor does it offer any incentive financing rates for the first 3-6 months. It's fee structure is in line with other credit cards I hold with typical foreign transaction fees of 2.7% and 3% on cash back. I do like that it doesn't have an annual fee. Basically this card serves the role of the credit card (for which I give it only 3 stars) but doesn't have any of the bonus offers that people now come to expect.</p>",

They have the sign-up bonus points, they have incentive bonus programs for select purchases like gas and supermarkets, and they have a base point program for all other purchases. This is the same sort of thing I see with the Amazon rewards card or the Barnes and Noble rewards card. Probably the thing that throws off some users is that 3 points equals $1.  Why not just make it 1 for 1? Fees are pretty comparable across other credit cards I own. Really the rewards are what make this card a solid one to use!</p>",

The atm fee in terms of dollars is comparable to several credit cards I own. Seriously guys, no monthly fee and clearer terms and this could be a much better card.</p>",

Once you spend one thousand dollars, you get one hundred cash back, that's American Express just giving you ten percent back on your first one thousand in purchases. The rewards system is very straight forward, and is actually a fairly nice reward system giving between one and three percent cash back on purchases. The annual percentage rate is actually nice because it is based upon your credit worthiness and the upper limit on the card is fairly high, but not outrageous for someone with a below six hundred credit score.</p>",

It will take them 3-5 days to release the money.  If you need a prepaid card go get a Visa or Mastercard version and pay the monthly fee.

What I really like about this card is the ease of adding funds to your card, as well as the fact that there is no activation or monthly fee.

Yes there are some small buisnesses that don't take American Express but it's easy to just get cash from an ATM. I've heard some people complain about using the mobile check deposit option because of how long it takes, but bluebird says right on it's website that it can take up to 10 days for funds to be avaliable so it gives you fair warning it's going to take that long, these people obviously haven't read the fine print, and all prepaid cards will put a $100 hold on your card if you preauthorize at the pump so that's something people just have to deal with. And this card actually has checks that you can get, which is amazing and unique. I definitely recommend this card!!</p>",

I heard a few people say that Serve can hold the deposit for several days before they make funds available, or, that they run a test first then a month later you would get your funds. That prospect sounds really scary to me. I can't find any specific information regarding this on their website.

And, surprise surprise, it works like any other card for point of sale transactions.  That's pretty much where the \"goodness\" ends.<br /><br /><br>After that, they send you a \"real\" card that you have to spend time setting up and confirming and all that goes with setting up an account.  So, it begins to lose it's \"minimal effort\" selling point pretty fast to reap any of the other functions of the card (like adding funds while NOT at walmart).<br /><br /><br>Then, expect your account to be suddenly \"flagged\" without being told anything or with no one calling you.  You then have to call in, provide copies of the front AND backs of cards that you use to fund the account, and go through other time consuming and painful measures, just to ADD money to the card. <br /><br /><br>Is it worth it?  I didn't think so, and even though I have to pay a fee when withdrawing money at non-bank ATMs, I went back to a bank just because I'm not going to let a \"free\" card seize up my money.  It's ridiculous . . . especially requiring me to PHOTOCOPY my funding sources to send in???  Sounds like an overseas internet scam more than a bank.<br /><br /><br>Oh, and there's no obvious way to reach these people in writing.  It's always going to take time on the phone.  Another ridiculous thing in 2015.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've been a Bluebird user for about 2 years, and I absolutely love it. No fee's no hassle, easy direct deposit, etc. We had an issue once where my card was charged at a Target in Texas(we live in Florida), and customer service was quick to fix the issue and send us a new card. So, I suppose customer service can be a toss-up just like anywhere else. The only drawbacks are, obviously, that many places do not carry AmEx, and the $2,000 monthly withdrawal limit only becomes an issue for me during tax time. There is a fee for withdrawal, however more and more gas stations such as Wawa, Thorntons and RaceTrac are offering surcharge-free ATMs. So its pretty easy to avoid any fees whatsoever. Furthermore, I absolutely love the BB app for my phone, it's absolutely painless to use.<br /><br>Over-all, I highly recommend Bluebird to anyone who would prefer not to use a bank. :)</p>",

The free cash reloads is nice as well as the other features including direct deposit, online bill pay, and a lack of monthly fees which is a huge plus.  Overall the costs are using this card are almost nonexistent so I can see this being a phenomenal gift item for a friend or family member, perhaps for a birthday or Christmas.  In short were I in the market for a prepaid card this would be a good a choice as any and I would likely recommend it to a friend or family member if the need arose.</p>",

They offer a lot of perks with this card - you can get into airport lounges at major airports for free just by flashing this card.  And if you have any problem with the card,  no worry - they'll send you for free another card by UPS next day shipping.  Bonus is good - 40,000 points equals about $400.  You'll get this if you spend $3000 in the first 3 months.  All in all, a very good card, as long as you spend enough to makeup the high annual fee cost.</p>",

The serve card works almost as great as a bank, but you need to keep in mind that it is still a prepaid card. So, it is bound to have a few short comings.<br /><br /><br>In my opinion the serve card is a great alternative to banks! The card looks official, nothing like the other prepaid cards that are currently out. You can view/transfer funds through the app or website. Little to no fees. You can avoid fees all together as long as you are reading everything thoroughly. Look to see every option that provided to you! You can even set up a reserve account that works like a savings.Hint to the wise do not try to deposit a check if you need funds immediately. It will take at least 6 days to process, use your own bank or another source if you can not wait for that time period. Electronic deposits and cash is the best method because funds are received instantly! Thank you Amex serve!</p>",

        "content": "<p>I needed a last minute gift. Purchased early on Christmas Eve, was told that funds would be available within the hour. I bought it so a young family member could do some online Christmas shopping. You have to register to card to someone over 18. No big deal I put it in my name. Then try to register it after I gave it. THE SECURITY CODE DOESNT MATCH THE ACCOUNT! So the card is useless, until I receive a permanent card in the mail. And my niece has been left empty handed!!! What a joke, now three days later and I am trying to get my funds back and the initial 3 dollars I loaded. Be vary careful purchasing prepaid cards. I regret this impulsive move.</p>",

Getting approved for this card requires the best credit and history. That being said, let's discuss the card. This card is fully insured. You are not responsible for purchases that you did not make. Furthurmore, you are protected up to $2000 on purchases. Ordered something from Amazon and it came damaged in the mail? If Amazon can't fix the problem, call Amex, and they will take care of it. Need V.I.P access to lounges and certain venues? This card will vet you in fast. Point are pretty good for rewards, however, this card does not offer as much rewards as other cards.  Customer service is great. 24/7 customer service. Lost a card? They will FedEx it overnight with no charge. If you can afford to pay $450 a year, and need perks, the American Express Platinum card is definitely for you.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Amex EveryDay Credit Card from American Express is for cardholders with an Excellent credit score (FICO score above 720). With this card, there is a 0% interest rate on purchases during the first 15 months of usage, as well as a 0% interest rate on transfers during that same time period. The regular interest rate afterwards ranges from 12.99-21.99$ depending on your past credit history, and while this is slightly high, good credit can keep it closer to the minimum. There is no annual fee with this card, no annual fee for additional cards, and no maximum overlimit fee. However, the maximum late fee is a hefty $38, and the maximum penalty APR is 27.24%. The grace period is 25 days, which is more or less the median time frame for most cards. Additionally, there is Smart Chip technology in this card, which is a special kind of payment verification. <br /><br /><br>With regard to rewards, this card gives one year of Amazon Prime membership, as well as 10,000 Membership Rewards points after you have made $1,000 worth of purchases within the first three months. You do get automatically billed every year after that so if you do not want to continue the membership you have to remember to cancel. If you make 20 or more purchases during a given billing cycle, you can earn 20% more points on those purchases. US Supermarkets earn you double the points until you've reached $6000 in purchases there, and then reverts back to 1%. Other purchases earn you just 1%. <br /><br /><br>For those who travel, there is a Membership Rewards \"Pay with Points\" program that allows you to pay for part of or all of a flight and prepaid hotel stays; however, there is a foreign transaction fee is 2.7%. You can transfer points to over 20 frequent traveler programs. Second, there is car rental loss and damage insurance, and depending on specific details, you can be covered for a stolen or damaged vehicle. Third, there is a Roadside Assistance Hotline, though you have to pay for third-party service costs. Fourth, there is a \"Global Assist\" Hotline that helps with sudden changes in plans that you may need guidance with when you travel more than 100 miles from home. Last, there is travel accident insurance. This covers accidental death and dismemberment in specific circumstances. Overall, this is very good coverage for those who travel and want some kind of benefit that goes beyond simple monetary rewards.<br /><br /><br>When shopping, the card can add up to one year added to the manufacturer's original warranty, as long as it is a warranty of five years of less. If a store won't take an item back within the first 90 days of purchasing it, you may be refunded the full price if eligible. There is purchase protection, dispute resolution, and \"ShopRunner,\" a 2-day shipping program with free returns. The Membership Rewards Program allows you to use points for rewards with over 500 brands, and there is no limit to the rewards you can earn. This is a great card if you travel and also make purchases regularly. If you have excellent credit, as this card requires, you shouldn't have a problem with any kind of late fees.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Gold Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Credit Card from American Express<br /><br /><br>\tFor those who find themselves traveling a greater than average amount, the Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card is a fair option with great benefits in the beginning of membership. Unfortunately the early sign up bonuses you can earn in the first few months of membership are far better than what you can earn early on. Customer service at American Express seems to be hit or miss. Sometimes you will find someone who will pull out all the stops to help you, other times you might find yourself scrambling and frustrated to get the assistance you need.<br /><br>Cost<br /><br /><br>Balance Transfer Fee: For all incoming credit card balance transfers into your Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card account you will be charged 3% the amount of the balance being transferred. Compared to other cards with a Balance Transfer Fee this fee is on the low end of the amount charged per Balance Transfer:<br /><br /><br>Annual Fee:  The first year, users of the Gold Delta SkyMiles are exempt from the annual fee. Thereafter the Annual Fee is $95.00<br /><br /><br>Pros<br /><br /><br>Two Bonus Opportunities In The First Three Months: During the first three months of being a Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card, there are two bonuses that users can earn by using the card. First, if you make a purchase with Delta within the first three months you will receive a fifty dollar statement credit. The big reward is the ability to earn 30,000 bonus miles by spending  $1,000 using your new card.<br /><br /><br>Earn Double the Miles When Making Delta Purchases: When making Delta purchases with your Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card, you earn two miles for every dollar spent.<br /><br /><br>Earn Miles Wherever You Spend: When using your card for non-Delta purchases you receive one mile for every dollar you spend.<br /><br /><br>Free Checked Luggage: For all Gold Delta SkyMiles cardholders, the first piece of checked luggage is complimentary on each flight.<br /><br /><br>Priority Boarding: All Gold Delta SkyMiles cardholders are entitled to priority boarding when flying on Delta.<br /><br /><br>Cons:<br /><br /><br>Higher Than Average APR: Like most rewards credit cards the Gold Delta SkyMiles credit card does have a higher APR that ranges from 15.24% - 19.24%. However, compared to the other rewards credit cards, the APR of the Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card is fairly standard. The penalty APR of 27.24%<br /><br /><br>Occasional Inability To Use Card: It's common knowledge that a select number of businesses do not accept American Express cards so users should make sure to have an alternative form of payment available.<br /><br /><br>Dropping Value of Rewards After Your First Few Months: While the card does offer some great rewards, unfortunately the time to get the best rewards is right after you become a cardholder. After that the amount of miles earned per dollar spent is pretty benign unless you are making a purchase specifically with Delta.<br /><br /><br>Other Numbers:<br /><br>Max Late Fee: $38.00<br /><br /><br>Grace Period: 25 Days<br /><br /><br>Cash Advance Fee: 3% (Minimum $5.00)<br /><br /><br>Cash Advance Rate: 25.24%<br /><br /><br>In Conclusion:<br /><br /><br>\tThe Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express overall falls into the middle of the middle of the pack compared to the other rewards credit cards. It's main issues is the fall in values of the rewards after your first few months as a cardholder. Also there are many other airlines rewards cards that have a better miles to dollar return than this card. To be fair however, many of those cards have much higher fees and APRs. Finally a common theme with the Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card seems to be problems with American Express' customer service. All things told I'd give the card a D in terms of letter grade and 2 stars.</p>",

The fact that the Hilton HHonor Credit Card has no annual fee makes the card worth it alone. The real benefit of this card, though, is the HHonor points. After accumulating the points for some time on this card, I used the points to book a nice little room in the Hilton Grand Vacation Suites, just a block off the Strip in Las Vegas!  <br /><br /><br>Now down to the brass tacks. The rate should you not pay off your balance is a bit high, but all credit cards will have a rate much higher than you\u2019d like. The one part I will have to knock the card on is the 2.7% foreign transaction fee. This alone keeps me from making this my primary card as I travel often to Europe. Overall a pretty solid card if you pay your balance.</p>",

        "content": "<p>American Express Serve Prepaid card is great because it only costs $1 per month and IS prepaid.  I think prepaid is great because it can help people who do not have great credit.  It also helps keep me 'accountable' because I am not going to go into further debt with this card.  I can use direct deposit free of charge and I have the great AMEX 'power' that is widely regarded as a high status card.  Most importantly this card is functional to be used at many retail shops and online as well.  Ultimately I think the free ATM withdrawals at over twenty four thousand ATMs is outstanding and is a service to be applauded.  I love the card for that reason alone as ATM fees are so annoying and so wasteful in my humble opinion.  This card is an asset that can be highly functional and valuable in its usability and low cost to maintain attributes.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Platinum Card from American Express is just alright. I am not too keen on the fee I have to pay of $450 each year to have the card. I have Discover Card as well and they are much better with not nickel and diming you for everything you do with the card. I guess that is the price you pay for getting amazing rewards back. I spend a lot so the points really add up fast. I really like the extra features the card provides like the ability to make a last second reservation at a nice restaurant around town. I do not get that perk with the Discover card and that is a really nice benefit to have since life can be hectic sometimes. Overall I like the card but make sure you read the fine print so you understand both the positives and negatives associated with becoming a Platinum Card Holder.</p>",

First off it takes at least 5 days to transfer money on to card from a bank acct. (even though I saw it sent to SERVE card two days after requested I can't use it till after 5) Then, I made a mistake in entering my debit card # and it blocked my SERVE card. Even though they had my bank acct # and had gotten money successfully from there, they blocked all money coming from my bank. I had set up auto transfer and my bank  sent them $200 ,but it was not on my card. I called and customer service said it was fine the money would clear. I got an email requesting all this information (my id,copy of the front and back of my card bank statements). I called customer service \"oh your acct is fine\" I had to tell them there was a problem.  I was on hold 15 min before she confirmed I was right. I decided not to send the info because it is not that serious for me. But, called again to  ask for an address so I could have my bank mail them a check (since it takes a week anyway) customer service didn't know A MAILING ADDRESS. I was done with the card ,but I needed my 200 back my bank sent. One call 2 min and my bank started the process and put it back. If you want to use this card to help with your problems spending or balancing out your money  it will only make it worst.</p>",

The reward bonuses can be redeemed as a statement on the credit, which is also excellent.

When the purchase screen came up the Gold card number did not populate so I had no way to use it. When I called American Express service I was told i had to wait until i received the card in the mail. They said they were unable to give me the number over the phone and could not cancel the card. I asked to speak to a manager in new accounts who said she cancelled the card and I could reapply and get the number online to use at time of purchase. When I did this I was, once again, not given the number online to use at the time of purchase.  Grrrr.  I was hoping I missed something the first time. So now I applied for the same card twice in a day (which will ding my credit score) and no American Express agent was able to solve my problem. I bought the tickets with a Visa and earned none of the promotional promises. As an American Express card holder for over 20 years I am very disappointed in their service and misleading online promotional promises.</p>",

Then I did the direct deposit, and that worked wonderfully. Then I tried funding my Serve card from my debit card attached to my checking account. I noticed it funded the card almost immediately and took the money from my checking account immediately, then two days later I noticed a \"debit hold\" on my debit card for the same amount I had transferred. The debit hold was there for 3 days causing a check I had written to be returned for insufficient funds. I called my bank who told me I needed to call AMEX and get them to release the debit hold. I called AMEX Serve customer service and the person I spoke was all helpful telling me the funds had cleared and are on my Serve card. I explained to her it was not the funding on my serve card that I had an issue with, it was the debit hold they placed making the transfer I made double what I transferred. She promptly put me on hold for 10 mins came back and told me that they only pulled the original amount out of my account. I told her yes the money was physically taken from my account in the correct amount but AMEX had the same amount held via a debit hold. She put me on hold again this time for 20 plus mins, came back on and said there was nothing she could do about releasing the debit hold.</p>",

You completely forget until you're minded on your statement and all of a sudden you can get a couple 'free' gift cards to spend on dinner or a favorite store. I wish they'd tell you what the points were actually worth though. 40,000 points seems like a lot, but if you need 50,000 points to redeem them then its just a whole lot of nothing. <br /><br /><br>There's a $200 annual airline credit, but the purchaser of the card needs to declare the one airline they can use it on? Why? Why is that even a thing? Why can't they use the credit wherever? That seems like one of those catches that keep you from ever ACTUALLY being able to use a benefit. That's just Murphy's Law. When you need a flight, that  $200.00 credit will still not make the flight you CAN use it on cheaper than that flight over there. So, it becomes pointless and frustrating.<br /><br /><br>Ultimately, though, the $450 annual fee is STEEP. Right there, the platinum Card from American Express is a no-go. Why? You don't have a preset spending limit, but you can approve or deny purchases? So, there ARE limits on spending. If I don't have that one advantage, why would I ever pay an annual fee don't require them?</p>",

Next, I wanted to pay two bills through my card automatically.  I have plenty of money on the card and they rejected the payment and I almost lost my auto insurance.  The third thing is that I took my son to Appleby's and in case no one else knows this but they expose how much you have on the card (your balance) on the receipt.  I noticed AMEX for Serve will actually state on the receipt for Appleby's how much you have left in your account for the server and everyone to see that is putting money into the cash register.  So, if someone hacks my card they will know how much to spend.  What a terrible thing for a company to do.  AMEX does not care what private information of yours they put out there.</p>",

Last year I got with more than $400 NSF and bank fee. This year I got hit with over $100 in NSF and late fees. That is more than $500 in NSF right there... Why was I hit with so many you maybe asking? Thinking that the charges to my card would \"bounce\" for the charges that occur monthly (phone bill, etc.) while I spent some in a fee places without recognizing that the \"bounce\" only occurs when you sign a 1 month contract each month at a physical bank location. For me $12 for a whole year sounds good to me. Though the problem with this card is that I just recently received this card and never used it. About a week latter I received a e-mail from AMEX saying that this card had some sort of error on it so they decided to send me a new one.  The shipping is SLOW because it will take them something like a week to ship it to me. So officially 2 weeks of waiting for a card that works to come in.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Cash Back on Groceries:<br /><br>This card first caught my eye because of the benefits it offers. It offers 6% back on grocery purchases. This is attractive because it comes back to you in cash - not in points or air miles that limit how you use them. 6% back in cash is great, especially because of the wide variety of items you can get at most grocery stores now. Think about getting gift cards to starbucks, amazon, or some other place at a grocery store and getting the cash rewards on it. You can also get 3% cash back at gas stations and department stores. That is essentially 9 cents off per gallon if gas is priced at 3.00 per gallon. Another perk is the sign up bonus. You can get 100 reward dollars after you make $1,000 worth of purchases in 3 months. This might seem like a lot if you don\u2019t plan on using the card much, but I\u2019m sure you could think of a way to get up there. Between buying my books for school, paying off some utility bills, and buying monthly groceries, I was almost there.<br /><br /><br>Introductory APR:<br /><br>The introductory APR of 0% was another big attraction for me. Usually, with a trait like that, you would expect the APR to be huge when it kicks in after 15 months. Depending on your credit, it might be. The APR can be between 12.99% and 21.99% based upon your creditworthiness. The low end of that range is very desirable, so if you have good credit, this is a very attractive feature. Even with mediocre credit, the middle range of this APR is not that bad, and is comparable to other cards you might find.<br /><br /><br>Other Perks:<br /><br>The additional benefits are also nice perks that are valuable all by themselves. Roadside assistance, car rental insurance, fraud liability, travel insurance, purchase security, price protection, and emergency support are all things you get with this card. I thought there would be some kind of catch, but these are all standard features.<br /><br /><br>Drawbacks:<br /><br>Of course, nothing can be perfect or too good to be true, so there are a few bad traits of this card. The annual fee of 75$ is a high one. This can be negated if your spending habits allow you to rack up that much in cash back. So this is one thing to consider before you apply, and one thing to keep in mind after you get the card. Consistent use is necessary in order to make the fee worth it. This trait makes the card one that you will want to use frequently, not one for emergencies or occasional expenses.<br /><br>If you travel a lot, watch out for the foreign currency transaction fee of 2.7%. This may not seem like much, but it can add up quickly if you are not careful. You will also want to consider how much money you spend on groceries because there is a cap on the 6% back. The limit is $6,000 per year. After this, the reward drops down to 1%. This limit is irrelevant to me, as I usually only buy groceries for myself.</p>",

I also earn bonuses, like 10,000 points after making $1,000 in purchases for the first three months, which I did easily. I can also earn double points at supermarkets, where I\u2019m frequently using my card. Also, unlike many American Express cards, there is no annual fee on this card, and the intro rate on purchases for 15 months is 0%. My only complaint is that not everywhere takes American Express so sometimes I am limited as to where I can use this card.</p>",

You only have to spend 750 dollars in three months, that is not bad at all. I really like that is does not have an annual fee, I am completely against all annual fees for credit cards. It seems very easy to earn points and there are ways to earn different amount of points. I think that the max late fee is a little high at 37 dollars but there is a grace period of 25 days so that somewhat makes up for it. This is similar to my Discover card but with my Discover card I get cash back instead of points but either way I think it is nice to know you are getting something, whether it be points or cash back when you make a purchase.</p>",

I have never had a problem using the card with any merchant, including at hole in the wall establishments and mom and pop gas stations.  I have always been able to get cash out using this card at ATMs.  If you want a prepaid card, I challenge you to find one that can beat the awesome low rates of this card.</p>",

In accurate, tried to get a supervisor, they won't get one on the phone, rather they say it will be 24-48 hours for one to call you. When I did finally get a supervisor, they could not explain how I violated the policy only that I did.

It enabled me to pay for a hotel room for my family online for a better price then I would have gotten just going to the front desk with cash. My issues with them were after the card was validated, it wouldn't let me add a bank account or transfer money from my bank to them. I had to call customer service to get it working. Then the card was charged for more than was on the card and it happened again! I went to pay the difference so that I could continue to use my card and it again wouldn't let me add a payment method. I had to call customer service and go back and forth for a few days. They couldn't figure out what was wrong. They ended up having someone reset my card from inside their system. So overall, I would suggest getting this card if all you want to be able to do is add physical cash to it, it's not the greatest card to utilize otherwise.</p>",

The $75 credit on hotel expenses and using your points for airline travel would make this a great card for people that travel frequently. However, I am not one of those people, so this card doesn't seem that useful to me.</p>",

They \"lost\" both of my request for money to be transfered to me so that I could go pick it up. Once I finally got them to transfer money through Western Union. My name on my ID did not match how it was typed into the Western Union Transfer System. So, I called them back to tell them how the name should be spelled out. I waited for 1 hr on hold because they were trying to \"figure out\" what happened. I finally got a hold of the account supervisor and told her the whole story and she assured me that she would get to the bottom of this. She promised she wold call me back within an hour or so..I said \"ok thank you\"....Well, that ended being a lie. So, its save to say I will no longer have this card or be a customer of AMEX.

I've gotten $75 dollars in free credit for various things since I've signed up! I love the convenience of being able to use my phone to utilize the tap to pay feature and get $1 for each time I use it. I've seen a lot of people on here talking about how bad the customer service is. I've had two minor problems since having this account. The first problem was I prepaid at the pump at a gas station once and for some reason they take out more than what you paid to make sure you have enough money in your account which is pretty dumb but I called them up and they put the money back in my account instantly and just let me know that they do that so now I just go inside to pre pay... Not a big deal. The second problem I had was I was charged the wrong price at a bar for some drinks so the bar had to void the charge and charge me the right amount and it was about a week later and the money hadn't gone back into my account yet. So I called customer service and they took the charge off on the spot and told me that next time that happens to just call them immediately and they would fix it right then and there. This is a great card that lets you have an account without being tied to a bank and you can also set up a reserve account which I just use for my savings. I highly recommend it for anyone.</p>",

We have been a card member since 2006 we ALWAYS make our payment before or on the due date and we always pay way more than the min balance Example: Our min payment is around 50 we always pay 200.. Well we were out shopping the other night and had to buy a few large items when we got home and I got online to see our available balance it was $0!!! It is supposed to be $3,000! So I thought it was just a glitch in the system so I called them and they said they took away our credit limit! I asked for reason's and they would not really give us a reason, Our credit is not Excellent but it is not poor! We have nothing in collections and we ALWAYS pay our bills! The manager told me in order to get our available balance back we had to pay the $1,200 off in 30 days or they would not due it... They also said there decision was based on the fact we had not used out card in a year! I about exploded we have been loyal customers from 2006 we have other credit cards and they have NEVER treated us like this! I told them to cancel the card we will not be coming back! Poor customer service is also a BIG thing, I was hung up on once because I was trying to get answers as to why they did this! I don't suggest ANYONE deal with this credit card!</p>",

You're only allowed to take out $2000 cash each month. If I could pay my bills with this card that wouldn't be a problem but I need to withdraw cash to pay bills.<br /><br /><br>- Customer service is a complete joke. When I insisted they allow me access to the entire amount of funds in my account they said it couldnt be done. I reminded them that this is not a line of credit  ,it's a pre-paid account FUNDED BY ME!  They told me the only way they could allow me access was to wire the funds via western union to me. I said, \"do it\". They said it would take a little bit of time and I probably would not get the money until 24-48 hours later. Again. I said, \"do it and close the account\". They put me on hold and left me there for an hour and 16 minutes before I was disconnected. <br /><br /><br>WORST PRE-PAID CARD EVER! Pay the small fees with another card.  Money well spent to avoid the inconvenience of a Serve card.</p>",

You can't really beat the 40,000 points offered for spending $3,000 in the first 3 months. I personally wouldn't recommend this card. I would recommend the Blue Cash card (I have been using this card since 2001). This card basically have all the benefits of the Platinum card minus the annual fee of $450. Some benefits are merchandise replacement within 30 days of purchase, returns of merchandise if the merchant doesn't take it back, one year extended warranty added to manufacture warranty, and great customer service.</p>",

You might as well just call the government and give them all your bank account numbers and everybody you have in your phone book just in case they can't find you, they can call and ask all your friends where you are hiding.

Also the insurance offered through the added travel benefits could come in very handy.

I have held both the Gold and Platinum card and I honest prefer the Blue Cash Everyday Card. The rewards are not that lucrative, but I use it for the benefits as such, replacement benefit, returns benefit, and the extended warranty benefit. I bought a phone without a contract that costed over $500 and it stopped working after 1 year and 11 months. The manufacture warranty is only 1 year, but American Express adds 1 more year to it. I sent the phone into American Express and received the full credit to my credit card. Talking about great benefits! That was like getting a phone for free for almost two years. I highly recommend this card.</p>",

The rewards program is not out of this world, but hey, at least it has a rewards program. I've looked into a lot of credit cards that don't. Blue also seems like a great card for travelers, offering 2X the points when booking a flight through AMEX travel and providing the chip technology for easier spending when abroad.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I wanted to give half a star here but the system wouldn't allow me to do so. <br /><br /><br>The Amex Serve Card is the bane in my life. Customer Support is terrible, which is really surprising considering Amex is known for their customer service. Their internal system is flawed in so many ways that I am probably going to lose some money for their incompetencies. I am still waiting to hear back from them after an hour-long frustrating call I had with them earlier this week at the end of which no resolution or respite was provided.<br /><br /><br>So here's what happened: <br /><br /><br>I had scheduled a monthly withdrawal on my serve card to help keep my finances in check. I later realized that the withdrawal amount will offset my savings so I changed my mind and wanted to revert/cancel the scheduled withdrawal. So I log into my account about a week or two before the scheduled withdrawal and see no sign of the upcoming transaction. I figured I wasn't looking at <br /><br>the right place and called customer support, who of course puts me on hold for a good 7 mins. Finally this lady comes online and does the general verification routine and goes through my account and confirms that there is no such upcoming withdrawal and that I would have to set one up if I needed to reload the card. I was a bit confused (because I was pretty certain that I had set this up) but happy that I wouldn't have to worry about money getting sucked out of my main account. I thanked the girl and asked her about how should I go about cancelling the card. To which she managed to convince me to stay and NOT cancel the card and gave me a thorough sales pitch on how beneficial and insignificant the monthly 1 dollar charge is. I decided to not cancel the card after the call. <br /><br /><br>The next day (or the same day... don't remember exactly when. But...) I transferred additional amount to my Serve card (now that I decided to stick with it). A couple days later I see that not only did my last scheduled transfer go through but the one before that (when customer support staff confirmed there was no transaction scheduled previously) as well, was processing. Bear in mind, it takes a good 5 days for the funds to come through into your card/account. Not having enough funds in my main account for this bulk remittance, I panicked (I did not want to pay any overdraft fees) and called Serve support. <br /><br /><br>By far one of the worst customer support I have experienced. And shocking, because it is an Amex product, known for their customer service. I  can go on and on about how rude, clueless, uncooperative, and lackluster the service was. Their system is clearly flawed. They have no regard for their customers' time or business. And they probably believe that if you wait long enough eventually your customer will forget or not care for resolution. So why bother?? <br /><br /><br>Now, I am just waiting to move/spend the balance amount on my serve card to cancel the service and get rid of this headache. Big mistake made when I signed up for this card. I seriously advise people reading this to go elsewhere where you'd be more valued as a customer.</p>",

Once I realized how easy it was so spend and earn rewards, I began to use it more frequently.  This card really is great, only default I dislike is the APR rate does increase further down the road.</p>",

This one fits the bill pretty well (15 months 0% is quite good) and the 3% on groceries is a real plus, as this is where most people spend their money anyways. However, I regret the limit ($6000 in purchases for a year, that isn't much) that I find quite low. The initial cash bonus ($100) isn't that great either. Overall, a good addition in the no annual fee/ 0% APR category.</p>",

I can not believe the HORRIBLE customer service from THREE of your managers that I received today. A hotel I recently stayed at double charged me. I three way called WITH the hotel manager to you guys to get my money back on my card. No matter what the hotel manager offered to do your customer service refused to help me for 8 business days. I do not understand how you can treat your customer in such an unprofessional and demeaning way. How do you not have a way to put money back on a card in a reasonable time frame? Not only would I never recommend this card again (which I did frequently) I now will be looking for an alternative pre-paid bank card to use. I expected so much more from a company like yours. I picked your Blue Bird card because of the American Express name and so far your customer service is ruining that name. Even the hotel manager could not believe the level of poor customer service we just experienced. And based on other reviews it does not seem to be a one time occurrence. It would be very helpful to have a customer service staff that clearly speaks English and is willing to help their customers rather than insult them. I would like my several hundred dollars put back on my card in a time frame that is reasonable and done at other reputable banks. If you want this card/bank to be taken seriously it is time that you start implementing policies and customer service training that represents that.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I finally gave up on bluebird after being loyal for two years. There are definitely some advantages and disadvantages. <br /><br /><br>Pros: Great features, easy access online(and a well working app for Samsung galaxy s4). The sub-account feature is nice, as well as the bill pay option. <br /><br /><br>Cons: A lot of vendors  no longer take American express, It was always embarrassing to get to a checkout lane and then realize they didn't accept american express. Always be conscious of what credit cards they accept. I would always forget to check and if I would have only remembered I would have saved myself a few embarrassing trips to checkout lanes. Fees at some ATMS(You have to scout out the ones that don't have fees), and if you lose your card, or forget your passcode online you're in trouble. The customer support is really quite a nuisance. If you get overcharged for something, it takes three days or more to go back on your card. You can also, only withdrawal a certain amount per 24 hours. So when it came time to pay our rent, we had to make multiple ATM withdrawals, which really would have cost the same as ordering checks(there is a fee for that too). If your atm machine that doesn't have a fee is down or broken, those multiple atm fees rack up a bit. <br /><br /><br>I was very happy with this card, and could work around other vendors not accepting American Express.(Just withdrawal some money to keep as cash on hand) We  lost our card  a few months ago and customer service was terrible.  If we had gone with a local bank we could have just gone over there and had it replaced but with bluebird takes up to a week to get a replacement. <br /><br /><br>Just last night my husband forgot the passcode to access the account online.(I'm usually the one that accesses it), and he got locked out of the account. He never even made it to the secret question. They not only locked the whole account, but refused to accept his direct deposit. That left us in a world of trouble, because it takes bluebird 3 days to send money back. We were already down to change, you know how it is when you live paycheck to paycheck. Luckily, his company is awesome and drove 2 hours from headquarters to give us a check. We decided this was the last straw and made a real account with a local bank.  Sure there are fees associated with most major bank checking accounts, but if it would save us the issue of having to deal with all these little flaws, then it's worth it. <br /><br /><br>The password problems, and the lost card issue were undoubtedly our fault, so I gave them a couple of stars and deducted two for their lack of care customer support. As far as quick prepaid cards go, this one is the best one we've ever had. So I'll give them credit for that. The VISA cards continued to deduct a monthly fee years after we had stopped using it. I found one in my wallet and checked it and it said -14 dollars. If you plan on using it for paying bills, and depositing large checks, it's not worth it, go with a real local bank, not a prepaid. Though, for the longest time, we had no issues with them, and could just work around the flaws.  It would be a great card for kids or teenagers, you can view their purchases easily and add money to their sub accounts from your main account. The extra account does not cost anything extra.</p>",

By getting 7,500 points when you spend purchases worth of $1000 is really good, but not all people are willing to do this heavy amount of shopping. What I don't like is the high fees on this card, I guess my Citi card works better with that. So this card is limited to a certain category of people going shopping or in \"spending\" mood to get those 7,500 points.</p>",

One of the things I really did like about American Express was that you can't charge more than you can pay. The card has to be paid in full every month, so it you have your finances in order and don't have to worry about min payments it's good for you. <br /><br /><br>There are a lot of benefits for the card, but I like my Chase Freedom much more. I get cash back on all my purchases and that adds up to free money for me. I can redeem for gift cards, transfer to my bank account, or get a statement credit. Plus my card is a Visa so I never have problems with it being accepted where American Express isn't. Depending on the time of the year, I can get 5% cash back with my Chase Freedom card compared to 1% at other times. The categories always change, but they are usually ones that I use often; movies, gasoline, eating out, etc.</p>",

Were told it would take a week. Didn't receive first one until almost 3 weeks had passed. Oops. By then she'd already requested a new one. Oops again. The only replacement card to arrive in 3 separate attempts was deactivated and not possible to activate once received because another had been requested. Eventually she opted to pull money out via Western Union but wasn't informed there was a limit on the amount of each transaction - $450 - are you kidding me?? If you have  direct deposit and your whole check goes in, you'll have to make a lot of trips back and forth to Western Union. Apparently they don't have this set up to automatically transfer once a request to withdraw all funds is initiated.  American Express and Walmart need to get their act together - this is preying upon those least able to speak for themselves.</p>",

The other downside of the card is that, even though it is a card aimed at travelers, there is still a fee for foreign transactions. The Bank of America's credit card aimed at travelers does not have a foreign transaction fee. That just seems to make more sense to me.</p>",

If you're consistent about using the card and getting the hotel credit ($75) as well as other rewards such as the complimentary room upgrades, you can easily make that $125 back and enjoy all the benefits of using American Express.   My USAir mastercard has a significantly lower annual fee, however it does have blackout dates -- this card does not.</p>",

Having three boys who can clean out a refrigerator in 2 days, this is definitely a huge plus!

While the interests rates are quite high, when used properly this card has great rewards and great for using for family vacations!</p>",

The annual fee is enough itself for one free round-trip ticket per year!  So unless you plan on making every purchase that you buy on this card alone it's not worth the benefit!  If you only fly 1-2 times a year it's much more worth your while to get a card with better points and simply purchase the airline tickets yourself!</p>",

You can also use them for frequent flyer miles. You can receive up to $75 in hotel credit, which can really help. What I do not like about this card is the $125 annual fee that has to be paid after the first year. That is not something I would want to pay.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Blue credit card from American Express seems to have a good amount going for it!  Definitely loving the fact that there is no annual fee.  I have had issues with previous cards, more-so from Capital One, that have had annual fees and they add up over time.  The 10,000 point bonus after charging $1000 in eligible purchases is a HUGE perk as it starts you off to great rewards right away.  It does have a pretty standard 1 point per $1 spent reward, but you do get 2 points per $1 spent when booking online travel through the American Express website.  0% interest for the first 15 months is great, especially when it comes to meeting the requirements for that 10,000 point bonus for the first 3 months.  The only complaint I have is that I personally don't like point systems.  I would far rather have it be a cash rewards system, but hey that is just my opinion.  Overall I would say it is a great card and give it 4 out of 5 stars.</p>",

        "content": "<p>My husband and I have used this card for almost two years.  When we signed up, it was with the $150 cash back bonus, basically offsetting two years of the $75 annual fee.  I'm not familiar with the Amazon Prime deal other reviewers are mentioning.  We will continue to use this card going forward though; the cash back is wonderful!  I put ALL of our groceries on this card, so we get tons back on the 6% grocery rebate.  The 3% on gas/department stores is nice, too, along with the 1% on everything else.  We actually recently started combining our use of this card with the Chase Freedom VISA card, using the Chase card for just the special 5% categories (it runs quarterly special cash back categories).  For example, when the Chase card offers 5% back on gas, we'll shift to using that for the quarter instead of this AmEx card.  The two cards combined would get 5 stars from me, but the AmEx just gets 4 because of the annual fee that cuts into some of the cash back (but doesn't cut in enough to offset the advantage of paying the fee, if that makes sense).  AmEx also has a very sleek and useable website and a handy spending analysis tool, along with some special card offers for shopping (available through the website) we can take advantage of.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The 10000 bonus points looks inviting if you're into point-related offers, but the need to charge at least $1000 in the first three months of owning the card needs to be considered.  The points offered are actually lower than many other cards, some of which give 3 points for grocery items where this card seems to max out at 2 for any type of purchase.  The 0% interest rate for balance transfers for the first 15 months might look inviting as well.  Just be sure to note that there is a 3% transfer fee added to a balance transfer; so you will be paying 3% interest on the balance transfer immediately.  The regular rate of 15-20% is high, and once you add the current rates to that it will be a lot higher.  If you're prone to making payments late, take note of the $37 late fee, which is also high compared to other card offers.</p>",

Versus the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, which I have had for several months now, this card is a step up in some ways, but does not offer any frequent flyer miles and the Capital One Card offers 20,000 bonus miles.  So if you travel a lot, you might be better off with the Capital One Venture Rewards Card.  The penalty on this card is better and that can be a big deal depending on your situation. The cash advance rate is poorer than the Capital One card but really it's better to never take a cash advance.   If it's an every day card that you are looking for, this card is the clear winner with a full 1% less regular interest rate than the Capital One Venture Rewards Card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I love my American Express Premium Rewards Gold card. The point earnings system is great and really adds up when you consistently use it for gas, groceries, etc. It's very simple to cash out your points through their travel website and it's very clear and easy to understand. The merchandise rewards are quite impressive as well. The products are high end and include apple products, high end audio, and quality home products. I received an excellent 50,000 point bonus after spending $1,500 over three months which wasn't very difficult. Those points cover a $500 airline ticket! The only downside is the $175 yearly fee which is a bit steep, however, the first year is free which makes it worthwhile.</p>",

None of the other credit cards that I have (Visa, Mastercard) charge such a ridiculous fee.  However, there are a couple things I like about this card.  The Roadside Assistance program looks great, and this is not something that typically comes with a credit card.  I also like that the card does not have a preset spending limit, which seems more flexible than many credit cards.</p>",

I have experience using the cards but never the Platinum Card. I currently have a Capital One credit card and I do not remember the initial bonuses being great like the bonus offered for this American Express card. Also, the \u201cNo foreign transaction fees\u201d is definitely a benefit for the continual use of this card. The annual fee of $450 is definitely a downside over my Capital One card but the prestige of this exclusive American Express Platinum Card and the benefits may be worth every penny. Unfortunately, I do not think my wife will be persuaded to change because of this high annual fee.</p>",

The American Express Membership Rewards Program is a great feature but I enjoy a little more flexibility in the monthly balance like I do with my current Capital One \u201cCredit\u201d card.  American Express is known for great frequent flyer programs and this card appears to have a great offer. Maybe when an actual \u201cCharge Card\u201d will be to my advantage over a \u201cCredit Card\u201d, I will review American Express Gold options again.</p>",

The fact that the balance has to be paid in full every month does not give very much flexibility. For example, if I was having a rough month financially and could only afford to pay $50 toward the balance, I would not have that luxury, as I would with other cards. I also was bothered by the $450 annual fee! If you are paying off your balance in full every month, I do not think it is feasible to charge such an outrageous annual fee!  On the other hand, if you enjoy earning rewards, this seems to have a pretty substantial reward program but I still do not feel that the $450 annual fee is justified by the rewards you may earn.</p>",

So that doesn't really count in your first year. That leaves the $100 initial bonus, not bad, and the 0% intro rate is nice. You could use it to take advantage of a big purchase you plan to pay back slowly. Overall, American Express is known for great customer service. This is better than store cards (not saying much) but worse than many other credit cards out there.</p>",

It is easy to load money onto the card, just make sure you avoid the ATMs with fees!</p>",

One of the great features of this card that I found to be a great annoyance with my old Visa was the foreign transaction fee rate.

The thing I like about the card is that you can receive reward points and use them for gift cards for dining, entertainment, and to shop at over 300 different merchants. I also like how I can get discounts and some low rates on hotels and resorts.  It\u2019s great not to have any annual fees for the first year. The only thing I dislike is that if you have a late fee from zero to the greater 35 or 2.99% of the delinquent balance would be charged to your accounts. Other than that it seems like a great card to have.</p>",

After using Capital One's Quicksilver card, I've become a huge fan of reward points that can be redeemed. They can even offset a minimal annual fee. But this $450 fee seems extremely excessive. Even other American Express cards don't have near that steep of a fee, which is what I think is the ultimate detriment to this card. If you can justify that fee each year, then it's certainly one to look into.</p>",

The Chip Technology included in this card is very convenient when traveling abroad, and this is one of the only cards currently offering this chip in the US.  The foreign transaction fee is slightly lower than others that I have seen.  This card is especially attractive since there is no annual fee and it has an introductory APR offer (which is par for many credit cards recently).  In conclusion, the APR, Penalty fees, and other terms seem average, if not slightly better than other cards that I have seen.</p>",

For a card that requires such a high credit rating to qualify for there are other cards with smaller annual fees.  But other than that that is the only negative.  The roadside assistance is very helpful if you take long trips or breakdown on the side of the road when traveling over a 100 miles from home.  Fraud protection is always a plus with all the identity theft going on and you can pay your card in full and pay no interest.</p>",

Still, I like that American Express doesn't gouge you with outrageous APR, and though their late fees would add up if you failed to pay them off each month, if you stay on top of your bills, it doesn't seem like a bad deal. The $125 yearly fee may be difficult for some cardholders, but that beats a ridiculous APR any day, in my book, and I do like the perks and points system, which you can use for dining, entertainment, etc. And if you travel a lot, there are discounts at some hotels, so this card may be an even better fit. So a good card overall, especially for those that travel and that are good with paying their bill on time.</p>",

It even comes with cash back when purchasing gas, which is a big purchase. I also am surprised that it comes with a amazon prime membership along with the 100 dollars it gives.

        "content": "<p>Blue Cash Preferred from American Express - 6% for groceries and 3% for gas, both great deals, but there has to be a catch. <br /><br>These percentages are high and not likely to stick around for long. It seems like they want to lure you in and then they will change the terms.  I will not ever have a credit card that I have to pay a fee to have.  The company is already making money off of my interest, and they want to charge me additional money?  So, in reality, you really are paying for the Amazon Prime subscription.  I like the 0% interest bonus but you better have excellent credit or your percentage is going to be sky high after 15 months.  I think there are better credit card options out there. The only positive I see is that you can use your rewards to pay your card balance.</p>",

It's very easy and free to load money onto it by going to CVS or 7-Eleven. There are some fees associated with the card, but by using direct deposit you can avoid them. I earned about $100 worth of League of Legends RP by hitting all the milestones and then afterwards I receive RP for each dollar I spend. If you play league of legends or need a low cost/free American Express card then I'd highly recommend this.</p>",

There are no types of activation or monthly fees, so it has that advantage over other prepaid cards. I like that they let you get up to three cards with your account. This allows family members the option to each have access to the card. This could be very handy if you wanted to use this card just for groceries or other expenses that you and your family want to keep on a budget. I also like that you can add money to the account using direct deposit - very convenient. The downside of this prepaid card is that they charge you $2 per ATM withdrawal (after your first each month). Outside of that, there is little reason not to consider the American Express prepaid card if you're in the market for a prepaid card.</p>",

There are NO fees with this card (except the small ATM fees) which makes it ideal for people who need/want to go the prepaid route. Most prepaid cards have a monthly fee or try to nickle and dime you every chance they get, but American Express has laid out a very user-beneficial fee program, i.e there are almost none. <br /><br /><br>This card is great, just keep in mind that not all retailers/stores accept American Express, that's the only drawback I can think of, everything else is perfect in relation to other prepaid cards on the market.</p>",

You don't get to carry a balance on the card which sounds inconveniencing but you never pay interest either. There is a small yearly fee of 95 dollars after the first year which is basically 7.90 a month. This best part about the card is the security. Any fraudulent purchase or stolen cards and you don't pay a penny. That's a lot safer than cash and you don't have to worry about online shopping or credit card phishing scams. The other added benefit is the rewards points which is the exact same as the American Express Gold Card so you know your getting great offers. Altogether I think this is an interesting idea and a great card.</p>",

I didn't travel, but I could see the big traveler was who this card was designed for. The customer service was great, but you need a very high credit score to get one. This would be a good choice if your employer uses these for company cards for expense accounts, because if you use it a lot the points really rack up. I used to give family members plane tickets with it because I was stuck working on the Internet most of the time years ago. Be sure to put 1k through it the first 90 days for the bonus, also if they give you a good limit you can balance transfer anything you can pay off in 15 months with no interest (but there is a fee).</p>",

The outrageous annual fee of $450 when looked at after examining the benefits this card offers isnt all that outrageous anymore. You get unlimited free 2 day shipping from amazon. That in itself if you shop a lot on amazon would pay for itself. You also get 25,000 reward points if you spend $2,000 within the first 3 months. One negative about this card is that the balance must be paid in full each month. This is a VIP card truly with the perks it offers, and in my opinion blows a lot of other rewards cards out of the water. I highly recommend this card if you qualify.</p>",

Then you got the overdraft protection so if something does happen they can't over charge your card either. There is no annual fee which is something i always look at because with a great card like this with no fee why get one with a fee? The points add up fast and you can book a flight with them in just a few clicks. This is a great card</p>",

For starters, it isn't much of a credit card given that the entire balance must be paid in full each month. Granted, that does allow a card holder time to acquire the necessary funds, but not nearly as much as other credit cards would. On the other hand, the rewards offered by this card are truly excellent. Pay with points allows you to pay for virtually everything without spending any money on it, using your accumulated points to finance your entire vacation. The real negative with this card is not the payment in full aspect, however. It is the annual fee. While it is waived for the first year, it shoots up to a steep $95 per year after that. Seems a little expensive for me given that the card does not really function the way others with much fees rates would.</p>",

What makes this card even better is that the 0%APR introductory period is for 15 months, 3 months longer than most cards. Take for instance the RC Willey card. It gives you 0%APR for 12 months. Overall the Blue from American Express is a great card to check out if you have excellent credit.</p>",

Do you purchase a lot of stuff from amazon, because if you do,  the unlimited free two-day shipping could save you lots of money if you do, easily overcoming that annual fee.  But then again, that\u2019s only for the first year.  After that, you have to pay to keep Amazon Prime.  How about the 25,000 reward point you get when you spend $2,000 in the first three months.  That\u2019s a nice bonus, but it\u2019s also a one-time deal.  After you get that bonus, there are no more like it.  So what it boils down to is that there are no real perks after the first year of ownership to offset that $450 annual fee.  My advice, keep looking.</p>",

The American Express Prepaid Card allows up to $5,000 in direct deposit and $2,500 in cash deposits per month which is considerably more flexible than other cards I have looked into in the past.  With AMEX prepaid, you have the option of having up to 3 cards.  This is particularly useful, especially when teaching children how to budget or monitoring their spending habits.  The one thing I am disappointed in with this card is ATM fees.  You are only allowed one withdrawal per month, after that you will be charged $2.00 each time you go to the ATM.  Other than that, I feel that the American Express Prepaid Card is a great option for anyone looking for the convenience of a prepaid card.</p>",

Right now, 95$ a year for each year after the first one is a little too steep for my wallet. There are far too many other cards that offer almost the exact same perks as this one, (minus the prestigious name of course). I would use it for all it is worth the first year, and then consider whether or not I would want to pay $100 each year afterwards. I do like the fact that I get points for travel for every purchase I make. I think that in itself is the card's saving grace for me.</p>",

The one thing I don't like is the foreign transaction fee.  If you're someone who travels a lot, this would be a bit of a nuisance.

The 6 percent grocery savings this card offers will be a valuable savings to the members of my family, and 3 percent on gas is nice also.

That is pretty unheard of and a great perk to getting this credit card. Another thing I like is the fact you get 0% APR for 15 months. Other than the initial points you get it seems like it would be very hard to rack up some more points with it being 1 point for every $1 spent. The interest rate after 15 months is not too bad based on other reward cards its well below the average. It is still relatively high APR but that's to be expected from a reward card. Overall I would say this is a pretty good rewards card.</p>",

This card offers NO annual fee, along with an introductory point bonus equal to 100 towards a car rental, airline ticket or hotel stay!  The only requirement to achieve the bonus is spending 1000 in the first 3 months.  The card has a respectable apr, that doesn't kick in for the first 15 months of use.  Obviously we all love credit card offers that offer a great introductory period, and zero percent for 15 months is great. This card also comes with all the benefits of having an American Express card, the cards offer great security, they are accepted almost everywhere, and come with an added bonus of offering an extended warranty on most items purchased with the card.  As long as the item purchased carries a man. warranty of less than 5 years, American Express will extend the warranty for an additional year.  Did you know that American Express users are also offered extended returns?  If you attempt to take a purchase back to the store within the first 90 days and the store won't accept it, American Express will cover the purchase price up to $300, and up to $1000 annually. What does your card do for you?  This is a great choice for anyone looking for a new card. <br /><br>In addition to all the benefits previously mentioned, you may have a card that the intro apr has expired on. Transfer that balance to the new Blue Sky American Express, and you won't pay any interest on the balance the only cost is a 3% fee for taking on the additional risk.</p>",

Let me say that \u201cTHIS IS MY MONEY!!!!\u201d  I direct deposit and put my hard earned cash on this card and I am limited at every step as to how, where, and how much of MY OWN MONEY that I am allowed to get.  I linked a bank account to this card and then after you shut my card down multiple times so that you can \u201cverify\u201d my bank account, I find out that I can only transfer $100.00 per day.  For the number of times that I had to call and send information and you shutting my card down made the $100.00 per day not worth the trouble.  Then,  I direct deposit my check on the card and American Express has all of my money tied up on this card.  After my first check was deposited I used the ATM for cash and of course it shut me down at $2500.00 per month!!! Funny how this is never mentioned until you need the money.   But, I can deal with that as long as my card works.  <br /><br>AMERICAN EXPRESS LEFT ME STRANDED 4 HOURS FROM HOME WITH MY HANDICAPPDED WIFE AND 3 MONTH OLD INFANT IN FREAZING WEATHER BECAUSE I HAD SPENT THE MONTHLY LIMIT ALLOWED ON MY CARD!!!!!!! THIS IS MY MONEY!!!! HELLO!!!! This is not a credit card... I put my money on this card I should be able to use my money to get my family home no matter what the circumstances...<br /><br>So, evidently, after I drove 4 hours from home to buy the food supplements that my wife needs LETS DON\u2019T FORGET THAT MY WIFE IS HANDICAPPED AND HAS TO HAVE SPECIAL CARE.  I find out that there is a $10,000 per month limit that you can spend of YOUR MONEY.  After my card didn\u2019t work at the store for my wife\u2019s food supplements, I called AMEX and of course the reason my card didn\u2019t work was because they had to verify my bank account ONE MORE TIME (this is the third time).  While I had the representative on the phone I once again emailed my bank account info and she once again verified my account and said that my card will be good in 5 minutes.   I went back in the store and of course my card didn\u2019t work.  I called back and after being on hold for another 10 minutes the representative answered and started going through the list of reasons that it might not work.  Then she said, \u201cMr. McBride, the reason your card isn\u2019t working is because you are at your monthly limit of $10,000 and your card will not work until December 1.\u201d  I explained to her that my ENTIRE pay check was direct deposited on that card and that AMEX had already limited me on ATM availability so that I had NO ACCESS TO MY CASH.  I told her that we are going to have to figure something out because this is going to strand me and my family 4 or 5 hours from home and that they need to at least let the charge at the store I was at and for me to get gas to get my family home.  She said, \u201cSorry, but there is nothing that we can do.\u201d  I asked for a supervisor and was on hold for 1 hour and 34 minutes and she never got back on the line one time to check on me or to let me know that she was trying to contact someone.  30 minutes into this call I called on my other phone to see why no one answered on the other line.  This lady was nice and helpful and she came back and at least let me know that she was working on getting someone.  After being on hold with her for 45 minutes she finally got someone on the line and they told me the same thing.  That AMEX WAS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME AND HAD NO REGUARD TO LEAVING MY FAMILY STRANDED AWAY FROM HOME.  DID I MENTION THAT MY WIFE IS HANDICAPPED AND SHE CANT WALK AND THAT WE ALSO HAVE A 3 MONTH OLD INFANT IN FREEZING WEATHER??? AND DID I MENTION THAT THIS IS MY MONEY THAT I DIRECT DEPOSITED FROM MY PAYCHECK??? <br /><br>I HAVE TO SAY THAT AS I MENTIONED ON THE RECORDED LINE THAT THIS IS MORE THAN \u201cOH, SORRY YOU HIT THE LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF YOUR MONEY THAT YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO\u201d THIS IS NOW AN ETHICAL ISSUE\u2026.. You can bet that I will do everything in my power to publicize this information and make sure that everyone knows the fine print that will leave your family stranded with NO HELP!!!</p>",

        "content": "<p>We love using this card for all of our business needs.  When we signed up we received over $500 in bonus points that were quickly used on some much needed expenses.  We love the no preset spending limit as well.  This has helped us purchase things that we haven't been able to easily in the past.  A lot of our business is done via credit card and being a newer business our limit was always reached easily on our other card that we have.  The things you can redeem your points for are also awesome.  There are so many different types of items you can get.  We also love the bonuses that they offer every season with different types of merchants.  I would recommend this card to any business looking for a great solution.</p>",

I've never heard of this as none of the credit cards I have offer a grace period. I think this is a good thing so that you start off not having to worry about interest charges immediately. I like that they offer points although I'd generally go for cards that offer money back depending on how much you spend rather than a card that offers points.</p>",

Some good quality's about this card is there are 24/7 emergency assistance when traveling and that is always good to have just in case something happens. Also there is no interest charges because you pay your balance in full every month. Also the Green card has no preset spending limit it just adjusts with you, however you use the card. I mean the good quality's just keep going and going about this card. The only set backs I see of this card would be is the annual $95 fee after the first year or the 35 dollar late fee. Other than that is card seems to be one of the best offered on the market. I know I was looking at a Capital One credit card the other day and it did not offer anything as good as this American Express Green card does.</p>",

The American Express Prepaid Card comes with the excellent customer service provided by American Express for all its customers at a smaller cost.<br /><br /><br>The card itself has few fees.  There are no annual or monthly fees, which are common with bank accounts and credit cards.  Secondly, transactions cost nothing, with the exception of ATM withdrawals.  There is one free ATM withdrawal a month, which is the obvious downfall to this card.  After the initial withdrawal, $2 is charged per withdrawal, don't forget the ATM you use most likely has its own fee to add on top of that.<br /><br /><br>The benefit however, once you have the card is there is no cancellation fee, nor an inactivity fee, which is convenient since you can keep it around for later uses.<br /><br /><br>Compared to other prepaid cards I have used, this financial tool is less expensive and less fee based than most, making it a good selection for a prepaid card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think most people commenting do not fully understand the way an American Express card works.  You pay a modest annual fee.  It works out at about $10 a month.  The first year is free.  After that, you make purchases throughout the month, and pay it off in full at the end of the month.  When you do that, you are not charged any interest at all on those purchases.  If you use your card, as designed, you will not pay interest on your purchases \u2013 that\u2019s why the $125 annual fee is so understandable.  American Express makes most of its money from the merchant fees they collect.  That is why this card is so desirable and exclusive.  It\u2019s not meant to be a long term financing option.  Short term unlimited borrowing is what this card is intended for.</p>",

The only reason I could see why an individual may not like it is because of the 495 dollar annual fee. The fee is easily compensated with the perks regarding this card. For example, you get 25,000 rewards points for spending 2,000$ in the first 3 months. The amazon prime is also a plus, and I have also used many of the perks regarding Ticketmaster presale concerts as well.  The platinum card is also practical when travelling, because of the non-existent fee. Their customer service is world class, and I have never had an issue, and by itself is almost worth the fee. I would recommend this card to anyone that wants something better from their credit card company.</p>",

But that said, as far as prepaid cards go this one is not horrible, it gives you pretty standard perks like ATM withdrawal and free pin use on the card and its monthly fees aren\u2019t too bad at only three dollars. If you really would like a prepaid card then look at the American Express Serve card that has no monthly fee and gives you a chance to have direct deposits for free ATM use, it seems like a much better option.</p>",

It has the mobile app and other features that are offered by other brands and prepaid cards as well. Everything about this card is free, but it does not say if it supports credit purchases or just debit. One problem I would have is that there is barely any money-pass ATM's around my area. If more ATM's were in my area, I would definitely go with this. This prepaid card is going to, hopefully, do exactly what it is named after: serve.</p>",

I can't say enough good things about this card. Their reward point system is really top notch. They offer a great initial bonus along with several perks and services. To top it off, there isn't a limit on how many points you can earn. This card is a must for frequent travelers. They also offer travel benefits like  baggage insurance, rental car insurance and travel accident insurance. They have everything you would need for traveling.</p>",

After your first 15 months, the interest rate isn't bad, a bit below average, at 17% to 22%. Their cash advance rate is rather high, so I would stay away from those transactions with this card. I do really like their rewards points. You get a fair amount of initial bonus points and there is no limit on how many points you can earn. For  every 7,500 points that you earn, they can be redeemed for a $100 statement credit toward any airline ticket, any hotel stay, car rental or cruise. I think this card would definitely be useful to frequent travelers, looking to save a little bit of money.</p>",

American Express has excellent customer service, and this most definitely extends to the American Express Prepaid Card. There are no activation or monthly fees - keep your money in your pocket. Many other prepaid cards, such as the Magic Prepaid Mastercard, come with a monthly fee. There are multiple options when it comes to making deposits to your card, which is highly convenient. The biggest downside is the limit of making one free ATM withdrawal per calendar month, and any additional withdrawals will be accompanied by a $2 fee. Shop with the confidence that if your card is lost or stolen, you won't be accountable for the fraudulent charges, just like with American Express credit cards such as the American Express Blue Cash Card.</p>",

Another downside is that the card is American Express, which isn't accepted at as many vendors as Visa or Mastercard, which would make it even harder to accumulate enough cash back to make up for the fees.<br /><br /><br>I always pay the bill on time so the interest isn't of big concern to me.</p>",

But I guess with all things that cost a bit of money, you do get quite a bit of perks. The first major one is, if you qualify, they give you a personalized interest rate. Lucky for me, I was able to get one locked in at about 10%. This is significantly lower than most of my other credit cards I have or had. Also, there is not a set credit line, they approve your purchases based on your payment history and your financial situation that is made aware to them. Pretty cool if you ask me!</p>",

I also see that this one forces the customer to pay off the balance each month, which is the traditional American Express model. Some other American Express cards have it to where this isn't part of the policy and actually allow one to pay the balance down over time which seems to be a better deal to me.

        "content": "<p>How can you go wrong with 0% APR and no annual fee? The Blue Sky American Express card is very good card, hence you have to have an excellent credit rating to obtain one. With a bonus of 7,500 points (after $1000 spending in your first 3 months), you practically have a $100 dollar voucher for travelling for using your card. With a 1:1 ration you can use this card towards any $100 voucher, whether its air, hotel, cruise, or hotels. The foreign transaction rate is slightly higher than most cards at 2.7%, and a 17-22% interest rate which is also on the higher side. But if you are looking for a card that is easy to maintain and get's you some perks, this card has a lot to it. If you are looking for more mileage or options for rewards, there are other cards from airlines themselves that give double miles.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This card seems very basic with little options. It is a good prepaid card for those who just want a credit card with no perks or benefits. There are no hidden fees, which is very favorable, for cancellation or signup. The $2 out of network fee though seems high. If you deposit twice $250 they add $50 to your account which is decent. Free money. This doesnt seem as attractive as vanilla, but having the option to add money, and then withdraw money is a highly desirable card in my opinion. It is a hybrid of a credit card and an atm card.  What also is cool is that you can email money to someone, none of my cards can currently do that. If only able to add points through spending, this card would be awesome!  The only question is how easy is it to add funds to your card, and where can you do it?</p>",

While it has great cash back perks on grocery shopping and gas, and there is a great initial bonus of $150, there is also an annual fee of $75 dollars.  If you start out with a low credit limit, this will eat away at your balance right away.  In my opinion, this would not be a good \"starter\" credit card for a young adult or college student due to the annual fee.  When I was starting in college, I opened a similar card with Capital One with a $300 limit and a $100 annual fee.  It was maxed out within a few months and I was stuck paying it off as a student.  Food for thought!</p>",

A great card for frequent travelers or people that want to save up free stays for a vacation, this card is a solid performer. The only potential downside is that this is an American Express card, which is not as widely accepted as the Visa and Mastercard alternatives.</p>",

What's the point of having a credit card if you can't carry a balance? Although the rewards seem great, I think there is more bad to this card than good.</p>",

The Bluebird account has higher account limits for transactions and balances, plus most of the same benefits as the Serve account (I believe the Serve account balance limit is $2500 in contrast to $100,000 for the Bluebird account).  Bluebird is offered through some partnership with Walmart.  If you like the idea of an American Express prepaid card, skip Serve and go with Bluebird.</p>",

On top of the fact that these rewards can only be used to pay your credit card bill, the amount you have to spend in order to reap any benefits seems high. I would much prefer air mile rewards that other credit cards offer. The no starting interest rate for 15 months, however, does appeal to me.</p>",

If you like to travel a lot and don't want to stay in motels, this is the perfect card for you.  Hilton is one of the top brands in Hotel accommodations so you know you won't be disappointed.  The best part about this card is that there is no annual fee.  A similar card, the Capital One Venture Rewards card has a $59 annual fee after the first year.  Free is always better in my book.  With the Hilton Card you get 3 points for every $1.00 spent and 5 points for every $1.00 spent at a restaurant or eligible supermarket.  Plus if you spend just $750 in your first 3 months you get a bonus 40,000 points.  You get complimentary Silver Status at all their locations just for having the card. It really is a great card for travelers who won't have to worry about another sleepless night in an unknown hotel.  Use your card like you would any card and you will rack up the points in no time to know that you are going to be traveling in luxury.  For any traveler or family that likes to vacation, I highly recommend this card.</p>",

So all in all, I guess both sides benefited from the relationship and then it was over. I am kind of glad that we don't have it anymore however, it doesn't carry as much of a status symbol as it used to and let's be honest, many small businesses don't accept them.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Of all the prepaid credit card options that I considered, the Bluebird Card by American Express was the most appealing for a number of reasons. First, the process of securing a card could be completed from the comfort of my home office computer station, and the actual card arrived in my mailbox roughly one week later. The activation process was simple, and then the benefits began to really unfold. Keeping accurate records is as simple as sitting down at any computer station and logging into my account. The security features of the login process are also reassuring. The Bluebird Card allows me to make direct deposits from employers, including many of the online monetary transfer options such as PayPal and government issued checks. There are no fees for using the card, unlike many bank account debit cards that can be accompanied by fees or charges associated with the account itself. Depositing actual cash money in my Bluebird account is as easy as a trip to Wal-Mart. The only potential fee associated with the card is for ATM withdrawals but that is waived with a direct deposit setup, and allows for free access to my money at any MoneyPass ATM machine. The card has an account number and routing number that are a checking account for transfer purposes, but Bluebird also has the option of setting up \u201csub-accounts\u201d for family members or friends, (who receive their own card controlled by the official cardholder), and also has a relatively new feature referred to as a \u201cSetAside Account\u201d. This is a separate place within your account page, which is like having your own savings account right at your fingertips. For prepaid credit cards, I am thoroughly elated with my Bluebird American Express Card, and would recommend it to anyone who needs to rebuild or establish a credit history.</p>",

I would hope if it costs you $450 annually it would provide plenty of overwhelming perks to cancel out the annual fee. I believe that is quite high compared to other credit cards. Also, your balance has to be paid in full each month, a big negative.  I don't really see the point of this card unless you travel very frequently and can take full advantage of the reward points. The only plus I really liked about this card is the entertainment benefits. I would enjoy being able to get advanced tickets but it says by invitation only. Another red flag for me. I also prefer Visa and Mastercard over American express, just a personal preference. Just because it is perceived as elite or high end doesn't make it a great card. There is no credit limit which is a positive, but I don't think it outweighs all the negatives.</p>",

The annual fee of 125 has been around for as long as I can remember. They do waive the fee the first year and you do get the option to cancel the card if you're not satisfied with it. If you take into account the yearly fee and the low interest rate it cost me about the same as my Bank of America Premium card does.

The AMEX Prepaid Card is almost identical to the Bluebird card that is offered at local Wal-Mart stores in the name of American Express also. One primary advantage the American Express Prepaid Card has over the Bluebird Card concerns the available alternatives to deposit or withdrawal funds. With fewer restrictions on places for withdrawal, the holder of the American Express Prepaid Card has a slightly better range of available options to get at their money. <br /><br /><br>Another appealing feature, although rather limited in scope, is the single free ATM withdrawal available on the AMEX Prepaid Card, whereas the Bluebird Card does not offer any free ATM withdrawals unless the user has a predetermined direct deposit in place from an employer or governmental agency. Both cards offer online management of the cardholder account, and the American Express Prepaid Card may lead to an invitation from American Express to apply for a standard charge card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Blue from American Express card offers good value at a reasonable rate. With its initial bonus of 10,000 points for 1000 dollars spent within the first three months, it gets you off and running on using its rewards system. There's a wide range of ways you can spend the points you accrue, and the double rate accrual on purchases made through their online travel site is good if you're a frequent traveler. With reasonable interest rates and no annual fee, the card compares favorably to others in its class. The 0% interest rate on the first 15 months of purchases is also extremely good. I like this card quite a bit.</p>",

One of my main reasons is that it doesnt have an annual fee.  Another great upside is that you can earn up to one point for every dollar spent. So that gives you a way to rack up points easily. Amex is a great company but one downside to the card is that its not accepted at everywhere. Another thing I dont like is when the apr does kick in its kind of steep!!</p>",

I've actually used the baggage insurance plan before, and it worked out pretty well, so if you're a frequent traveler, this would be a pretty good card. I also had a Capital One No Hassles Travel Card, but only really ended up using it to get the 2% cash back on travel purchases. The Hilton card really does go farther if you travel a lot. Another thing I like about the Hilton card is that there are no blackout dates for hotel stays, so it's nice to take advantage of during peak times.</p>",

This could potentially be what I was looking for. It would save me money on checks whenever I send money to people. This card does not charge for inactivity, which is good for a conservative spender like me. Using it does not mean paying more money than the amount of the actual purchase because this is not a credit card. I think I will apply for this, as it looks like a really good plan.</p>",

This card comes with a 24 hour a day customer service number that allows you to get assistance when you need it.

However, after the 15 month period, their interest rates are quite high, with the lowest offered being 15.24%. If you are smart and make a plan to pay off any purchases before the 15 months are up, then this card will be quite useful for you. Just watch out for the high interest.</p>",

But if you are in great standing and want a card that delivers, this is the card for you.  It is truly one of the elite cards on the market, and there is no fee for the first year.  The best part about this card is the unlimited purchasing power it affords you.  There is no limit and if you are ever in a crunch you know that you have exclusive access to credit.  The rewards focus more on exclusivity.  They have an unheralded Extended Warranty and Return Protection for your purchases.  My favorite aspect of the card is booking my travel through their Gold Hotel Collection.  You immediately get a $75 hotel credit.  Sure there are other cards like the Capital One Quicksilver which are comparable.  But they don't offer the perks that extended travelers like myself need.  They tend to focus more on the cash back as opposed to the elite benefits a frequent traveler with great credit like myself needs.  If you travel a lot, need purchase power, and are interested in a great card, do yourself a favor and give the American Express Gold Card a chance.  You won't be disappointed.</p>",

In the past, every prepaid card I have ever used has had a substantial activation fee. What I don\u2019t like is the ATM fees. Now, to use an ATM, there is no charge IF that ATM is within the Moneypass system AND you\u2019re enrolled in direct deposit. However, for one thing, the whole reason I wanted a prepaid card was to not have to use my bank as a backup \u2013 when the cash (intended for fun shopping only!) was gone, it was gone. Just like using cash, but with the ease of a card. I use prepaid cards as gifts and for myself instead of gift cards, because they can be used anywhere. But, it costs me $2.00 to use the American Express serve card at an ATM because I don\u2019t want to be enrolled in direct deposit. Plus, there are almost no Moneypass ATMs in my area!

There's no preset spending limit, so these cards can be dangerous.  The first year is great because there isn't an annual fee, but every year after that you find yourself paying $95.  You do get the benefit of the Global Assist Hotline which provides 24/7 emergency assistance when traveling more than 100 miles from home and roadside assistance.  That has value. Rewards are pretty easy to earn and flexible.  You earn about one point on the dollar spent and you can earn 2X points when you use American Express Travel.  The points also transfer over to 17 Frequent Flyer programs, which is pretty cool.  I gave it a two because it's not a card that most people would qualify for.</p>",

This credit card is a very good option when you frequently consider flying with Delta Airlines. Also, when you spend 500 dollars during the first five months, you get 50 dollars back. Moreover, the card holder enjoys having the first bag free on Delta flights.<br /><br>However, I had a problem trying to register this card online, the registration process failed several times for no obvious reason, and I had to call the customer service for around four times to get it resolved. Another problem, the online card console is not always up-to-date. It always tells about the next bill too late, about one week after the end of the previous bill date. Overall, I recommend having this card for Delta fans. It is a great option to have.</p>",

The \"VIP\" treatment this card gives you when purchasing event tickets is also really neat, especially if you're a concert dweller that loves getting front and center. This card is definitely made for a thrill seeker and the 25k reward points in the beginning is just about enough to make even the fuddiest of duddies want to seek some thrills. The fees aren't much higher than the competitors and the interest rate is also comparable,however; the annual fee is incredibly high, but understandable for someone wanting a \"prestige\" credit card.</p>",

The design on it is great, and it works just as well as any other American Express card, but without the credit part! The card being prepaid was a huge advantage, because it kept me from overspending. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that a lot of merchants and retailers don't accept American Express cards. Other than that, this is my favorite card. No fees, no hassles, just convenience. I hope to someday own another American Express card. Their customer service team is unbeatable, and always there to help you.</p>",

The cash advance rate is also high at 25 percent like every other card on the market. But the Blue Sky is a step above most with it's great point system. You earn one point for every dollar you spend like every other point card but you don't have to spend your points on some lame gift card, you can use it to travel. I use my card all year long, pay of the balance every month and redeem my points for a trip at the end of the year. So far this card has served me well and it even replaced my Bank America Travel Reward card that only gave me a hundred dollars for every ten thousand dollars I spent. Altogether this is a great card if you love to travel and want to save a little money.</p>",

The annual fee is quite high, but is pretty much offset by the rewards you receive when you use the card. The fact that there is no foreign transaction fee is also very convenient for travelers, making this the ideal card for anyone who frequently goes overseas.  There is no pre-set spending limit, allowing for even more flexibility.</p>",

The regular rate isn't bad although the cash advance rate is kind of high.  But then again, I would be using it mainly to make reservations so that really isn't too much of a problem.

For people that need to get credit started, this card is great because you could most likely get this approved with no credit.  This card reminds me of my first \"secured\" credit card, that card however did not earn me points or give me rewards, it simply built my credit.

It helps my credit rating and it makes sure I don't go further into debt. Both are perks in my opinion. If you travel a ton, which I don't usually then this card will come in handy. I don't use it much because I really don't have much reason too. I got it for a vacation initially and now it just sort of sits around and then I have to pay that silly yearly fee on it.

This reward card has some very promising rates associated with it like 6% of food products, 3% on gas and shopping goods, and 1% on everything else. The real winning feature here is the 6% on groceries, everyone needs to buy them, and 6% cannot be beat by any other card hands down. The rewards money you get can be automatically used on your credit statement lowering your full cost. There are not many cons besides the annual cost and credit required, and with that in mind I would say to give this card a further checking out before you pursue it and enjoy your new card!!</p>",

There is no intro rate for purchases and balance transfers which is always good, but in addition to that there is also no annual fee which is just icing on the cake. The main downside to this card is redeeming your points has a somewhat sad conversion ratio which is for every 7500 points you get 100$ a hotel/car rental/cruise/plane ticket. As a recluse I do not travel much and prefer my points going towards tangible things, but for those who enjoy vacations this could be quite nice!</p>",

It's a great feature where you can earn free rooms, especially if you plan on being on the road a lot.  However, if not, it can take a while to get enough points for a free room.  It would take spending over $700 with Hilton, just to get a free room, as Hilton says as few as 5,000 points can get you a room.  So if you're not a frequent traveler, look for other cards that fit your needs.  But if you find yourself in a Hilton Hotel often, it makes too much sense to register for this card.</p>",

This is mainly good if you want to give your younger sibling who do not have credit cards. They can  use this to buy things online, just like a credit card. What's also great is that they do not have a foreign transaction fees like the other prepaid cards have. If the card gets stolen, you do not have to worry about the money that you have in the card. Your money is well protected by american express and you just have to let them know about the current situation. Overall a great prepaid card.</p>",

As it is a charge card, you must pay off your balance in full each month or incur a fee of 2.99% with a minimum charge of $35. The only benefit you get from using this card is points for American Express Travel. You can find better travel benefits from a rewards credit card, including higher point rewards and extras like travel insurance and car insurance, neither of which this card provide. In addition to all the limitations of having an American Express card (which isn't accepted nearly as many place as Visa or Mastercard, especially overseas), after the first year you're hit with a $95 annual fee.</p>",

There is also no cap on the amount of points you can earn in the month unlike my Visa. The point system is also really simple to understand and every thing is laid out right where you can see it. Altogether I found this to be the better card and it eventually replaced my main card.</p>",

I've used the 2% rate at department stores around holidays and birthdays for gifts, and of course the 3% on groceries is incredibly easy to take advantage of. I think the only disadvantage is that you can't redeem the cash into your bank account, but statement credit is always nice to use later, and the reward categories are permanent.

It gets a lot of bad rep because of the annual fee, but that's from people who can't understand all the benefits.  Just for spending 2,000 over your first 3 months you get 25,000 reward points which is more than enough to compensate for the fee.  This card is NOT for everyone, but if you do have excellent credit and want the prestige AND the benefits of a rewarding card this is for you.  A similar card is the Visa Black card, but the annual fee there is $495 and they don't have the 24/7 concierge service which makes the Platinum Card from American Express unique and special.  If you are in the mood for a high end high benefit card then this card is perfect for you.</p>",

There is an intro rate of 0% interest for 15 months and you can earn up to 6% back on grocery store purchases. This looks like a good deal for a family who spends a pretty penny on their grocery bill. The regular APR falls between 12.99 and 21.99%. If you can keep your interest rate on the lower end, that seems like a fair APR. The drawback is that it is variable. That can sometimes be a burden if you are not careful with your finances. This card definitely beats the Capital One Platinum card I own by quite a wide margin. My card currently has an APR of 24.9% and I don't get any rewards points like the Blue Cash offers, but I got to design how my card looks, so take that Blue Cash!. If I had the credit score to do so, I would definitely consider this card.</p>",

I'd say my main gripe with this card is that it's an American Express card, so it's not accepted in many places still. Had this been a VISA card, I may have given it 5 stars. Interest is decent, and earning 1 point for every purchase ($1 per point) is a great way to rack up points.</p>",

Honestly other than the immediate convenience in the very short term IE not having cash on you, I think the fact that this card has no spending limit AND is a charge card so the full balance has to be paid down each month makes it potentially dangerous to the impulsive, but then again you need excellent credit so It is unlikely to get into the hands of people who are prone to that sort of thing. I think the points transfer program to frequent flyer miles and the roadside assistance is good though.</p>",

It's got a much better apr at 27.24 than a similar chase sapphire preferred.  It also has a 25 day grace compared to the sapphires 21 and it has online responses where the sapphire doesn't.  Plus every dollar you spend you can get up to 2 points and they start you out with 10,000 with only 1,000 in purchases over your first 3 months.  You can airline travel with no blackout dates with your points.  Definitely a card I love and recommend to anyone looking for a new card.</p>",

Moreover, there is no customer support fee for either automated or live support. Compare this to the Upside prepaid which charges 2 dollars for live and .99 cents for automated support. Also, there is a monthly maintenance fee of 4.95 if your account drops below 500 dollars. Another good thing about the American Express Serve is that there is no inactivity fee. The Western Union American Express prepaid is another good card, but it charges a 2.95 dollar inactivity fee after 120 days of non-use. I also like that there is an option of no ATM fees if you enroll in their Money Pass Network. The out of network fee will be 2 dollars. I think it is probably worth investigating how frequently you would be able to use their network. If you can avoid ATM fees for the most part, this would only sweeten the deal with this card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I like that Blue by American Express has a 15 month introductory period with 0% financing. My current credit card's, a Visa offered by Pay Pal, introductory period was much shorter.  It only lasted for 6 months and then the rate jumped up to 14%.  What I do not like about the Blue card is how high the regular rate jumps after the intro period. My experience is that if it says 15.24% - 20.24% it is almost always going to be much closer to the higher rate than the lower. I also do not like that they charge a balance transfer fee of 3%. I do really like about the Blue card that the points do not expire. That is a nice amenity.  In the past I have had cards where the points expired and I was not able to use them for one reason or another. All in all this looks like a great choice for a card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I like the fact that there is zero annual fee for the first year. For some people they do not like the fact they have to pay their entire balance. I think that this allows you to be able to control your spending, because you know what to keep your limit each month.  It will hopefully cut down on the need to splurge, because you know that you will have to pay back the entire balance and there are no interest charges. I love the fact that you can transfer points to your flying balance if you are a frequent flyer. The more points means the less that you will have to pay when purchasing a plane ticket. I also love roadside assistance. My account now prepaid visa does not offer a lot of these features. I would say that this is a great card to have.</p>",

You can also use this card for direct deposit if you do not have a bank account.  Also there are no fees when using this card and also you get one free ATM withdrawal a month. In my opinion, this is a bad because some people prefer to use this features more frequently, unless you are willing to pay the penalty fee that costs two dollars.  I barely use this feature since I only use it to make purchases online.  Adding money to the prepaid card is very simple and easy to do.

The interest rate is 12.99% after the 15 months so pretty average.The late fees are pretty standard but I wish they didn't have them though. What this card is really good at though is the rewards. You get 3% back at the grocery store and 2% back on gas. This is stuff that most people are going to get anyways. Might as well get a little cash back on it. Every thing else is 1% cash back. With a 100 dollar signing bonus you beat this card. I would really recommend this card to anyone to help get a little money back on the stuff your going to spend anyways.</p>",

Yes, maybe its a prestige to own one, but those $450 would look great inside my wallet than against my name! Its good for ones who spend a lot, look out for premium services and purchase regularly, but for an average conservative buyer like me, there is no real necessity to go for the platinum card. There is absolutely no cash back, which even a basic card would provide. Maybe its simply because of the annual fee that am not able to highlight anything positive about the card!</p>",

Everything this card does, my current credit card does, without the excessive fee or ridiculously high credit rating required. Furthermore, American Express is often not accepted at local retailers; making this card even less valuable. Unless you're a famous socialite, or a rich CEO; this card is not for you.</p>",

Having to pay off my balance in full every month may be seen as a negative for some, but I enjoy the simplicity it offers towards managing my expenses, and this way I don't have to ever worry about high APRs. The annual fee being only $125 dollars is very reasonable, and being that you have no annual fee at all the first year of use is quite a good deal. Though it is worth noting that the foreign transaction fee at 2.7% is a little high, and it frustrating when I go to an establish and only learn upon paying that they do not accept AMEX cards. Overall a great a experience though. I much prefer it to similar cards, such as the Capital One Quicksilver Credit Card.</p>",

The rewards program is also very beneficial, especially for someone that travels a lot; the 10,000 points initial bonus is a great start that offers incentive to the credit card user, and there are a fair amount of options that points can be used on. Try this card if you have the credit for it!</p>",

Further, what I love about having this card, is how vigilant AmEx is on suspicious activity.  I have had them inform me that there had been such and such purchase on such and such day, to which I confirmed was not my doing.  It was a 0 liability on my part.  They took care of the rest.</p>",

In this particular case, the Blue Sky card from American Express has incentives that I wouldn\u2019t likely use.  I\u2019m not an avid traveler; I rarely fly, and I almost never rent a car.  It is likely that I would accumulate bonus points that I wouldn\u2019t use.  It is nice that they start you out with 7500 points; however, you must accumulate a substantial amount of debt in order to be eligible.  The main reason that I would use a card like this is the 0% purchase and balance transfer period.  The 15 month period with 0% interest is a tempting offer.  The 3% balance transfer fee seems to be comparable with rates of competitors.  All in all, this is a tempting card offer for an avid traveler who will use the points, or for anybody who needs to shuffle balances around and doesn\u2019t want to pay interest.</p>",

All of these limits ultimately ended up only taking more and more money off of my card, and that is something which is easily avoidable with a card as reliable and honest as the American Express Serve card. Also, having access to free customer service both live and via the internet is a priceless asset which assures the consumer that if there is ever any question about their account which comes to mind, help can be reached at any hour of the day or night.</p>",

Unlike, say the Chase Freedom card many people use, few people will even be able to qualify to get one of these cards, and being rejected will just lower your credit score.  There's no \"preset spending limit\" but that's mostly a lie, as they will reject purchases they feel you don't have the ability to pay back, based on the info you gave.  So there's no limit but you can't make large purchases, so really there is a limit.  Then you have to pay it off in full that month, so even if you wanted to make a medium sized purchase you wouldn't be able to stretch the impact over a few months.  Additionally, there's a $450 fee every year.  End of the day, this is the perfect credit card....for people that don't need a credit card.  It's a status symbol that no one else cares about.

This card will only charge you a fee if you make more than one ATM withdrawal a month.  The nice thing about this card is that if you use it enough you might get invited to sign up for a normal AMEX card which you can use to start building up your credit.  They don't report your activity to the 3 major credit agencies, but for a card with very few charges this is a good first step towards that.</p>",

It's ridiculously low compared to what other credit cards offer on travel.  You can only redeem the points on travel related purchases, and if you transfer your points to other rewards programs you're going to get less than 1% back after the conversion.  You have to pay off your balance every single month too, so it's not really a credit card. And on top of all that, this travel focused rewards card charges a 2.7% foreign transaction fee!

The grocery perk alone is enough to justify this card, but if you spend much more than 6K per year you might not be getting the best bang for your buck with this card.</p>",

You can use them towards rooms at a Hilton hotel, or exchange them for other points programs such as frequent flyer miles for example.

You can earn an unlimited amount of points and spend those points on tons of different things you can choose from either; merchandise, gift cards, or transfer them directly to different airlines and hotels for instant transactions. American Express has some offers similar to cards I have had in the past, one of which is the PayPal CC and that gives you unlimited points to collect and spend however you wish, if you like to splurge on the occasional big purchases this is great as it has no annual fee so you wont be charged, and for those purchases you make money back, its a win win scenario!</p>",

But the bonus system isn't that great.  Getting 7500 points for $1000 worth of purchases is a nice jumpstart of 10% cash back that you have to use for travel, but after that the rate is really unfavorable and behind a lot of competitive cards like the Chase Freedom Visa or even the Amazon card.  Even if you're a frequent traveler, there's better ways out there to get more return on your purchases.  If you know you're about to buy a travel ticket, get this, spend $1000, get $100 bucks off, but don't pull this out very often afterwards.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The American Express Green Card sounds like a great card to use if you are ok with paying the balance in full each month. The great news is that you eliminate interest charges that way. The late fee charges are actually very reasonable compared to other cards I have had in the past. My Bank of America Visa charges $65 for a late fee. It sounds great not to have any blackout dates on travel points. My current card has so many blackout dates that I have to work around them while traveling. The $95 annual fee is pretty steep compared to other cards I have carried but the benefits may be worth it.</p>",

On paper it might seem crazy, with a $450 annual fee and needing to pay your balance in full every month, but the true benefit with this card is no credit limit.  I would assume that if you need to have a credit card with no credit limit, then you can afford the $450 annual fee which they are asking for. This card ranks up there with the Visa Black card as a credit card only rich folks can afford to have in their wallet</p>",

The fact that there is no interest rate is attractive although you must pay your balance in full at the end of the month. I do like that option though and I wish my current card  Capital One were more like this but I am rebuilding my credit. Eventually I think I will go for the American Express because of the perks. My only worry is making sure I budget properly so I could pay off the bill at the end of the month. No annual in the first year which is great but second year it becomes a $125 annual fee which is quite steep, but if you can make sure your rewards outweigh the cost well then I think its worth it for sure! I have heard great things about the customer service which is also a huge plus. I would worry that I may overspend to try and accumulate rewards and points but that is not a fault with a card that is more to do with myself personally. So I think definitely the risks and costs should be thought about before you decide on this card.</p>",

Usually American Express has some sort of annual fee associated with it, but not with this card.  On top of that you get the same fraud protection, member benefits and other perks that you would with any other American Express card.  For example, I have been registering my card every year for Small Business Saturday which gives you a free $25 credit when you spend $25 at a small business.</p>",

This is my best cashback offer and I buy everything on this card that is not getting a 5% promo on it's category on my Chase Freedom card. The only negative thing is that you redeem in chunks of $100 and sometimes I do not have a $100 related travel purchase on my statement.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Hilton Credit Card looks like a good idea for anybody who is constantly visiting places, whether it is locally, to another town for family and vacation or also for business whether it is domestically or internationally. You receive a base amount of 3 points anywhere but whenever you buy food and gas at both grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants you get points at 5 points for every dollar spent.  Whenever you make a purchase through the Hilton company you make on average 7 points per every dollar that you spend.  It seems that if you use this card any time that you travel you will easily be able to spend at least $750 in a year and be able to get a bonus of 40,000 points and if you're traveling and spending more frequently (whether for business or personal use) you'll probably be able to spend $20,000 and achieve Gold Status.  This is definitely recommended if you're a person that's regularly on the-go whether it's locally or out of town.</p>",

The annual fee is not cheap at $75, but the 6% cash back at grocery stores is extremely high compared to similar cards. If you have a large family or simply buy a lot of groceries, you could make the annual fee back in a few months of shopping. The 3% back at gas stations should also be attractive to those with long commutes. The 1% cash back on all purchases is pretty standard, so if you don't spend a lot at grocery stores and gas stations you might be better off with a different card. However, the intro period of 15 months with 0% APR is a great deal for anyone who wants to finance some large purchases in the near future.</p>",

It seems to me that if you are already spending money with a card then you shouldn't have to pay even more each year. The initial bonus for this card seems pretty nice. It's in point though unlike the Chase Freedom card which gives cash as an initial bonus. The interest rate seems typical to any other card out there, but the cash advance rate seems pretty steep. The best part is that you can keep earning bonus points to put toward travel which is great. Overall this is not a bad card but if you\u2019re looking for a good travel rewards card take a look at the Southwest card. It has better bonuses.</p>",

One hug drawback, however, is that they only offer one measly ATM withdrawal per month. Then, you need to pay $2 for every withdrawal afterwards. So if you get this card, it would be smart to keep half of your money in cash, and half in the card so you don't have to withdraw too many times. A good perk about this card is that you may receive more offers from American Express if you have a nice record. This card is also good for teaching young teens to learn how to manage money.</p>",

It makes it easy to get the 10000 point bonus, then slowly pay the 1000 balance back without accruing interest. The only thing about this card is that the bonus initial offer is not as good as the Citi Dividend, BoA BankAmericard, or Chase Freedom which give 100 dollars back for only $500 spent. Besides that, this card looks pretty great!</p>",

Just be careful to pay on time every time, or the interest rate will skyrocket to more than double, which is really the only caveat of the card.<br /><br /><br>The best feature of the card is the initial bonus of $100 that is easy to obtain, and then the cash back. You earn at least 1% back on all of your purchases, without having to do anything extra! Other credit cards require you to select certain categories of purchases for cash back throughout the year, but you don't have to do that here.

The only fee i really see with the American Express prepaid card is the transaction fee for ATM withdrawals and $2 per transaction is on the lower end and normal for cash withdrawals.

        "content": "<p>Hilton Credit Card looks like a good choice for traveler, especially if you stay in Hilton often. From the other side, it would be nice to know explicitly how much 1 point worse. The introductory deal is good. It comes with rather big purchase of $750, but in Hilton you probably spend it in one trip. The fees and APR look rather standard (the same or almost the same as British Airways Visa Signature Card, or Amazon.com Visa, or TrueEarnings Card). You have extra bonus for restaurants, gas stations and supermarkets, which is nice. No bonus points for airline tickets, so if you travel a lot and stay short times, you might consider some card with bonus miles in addition to or instead of Hilton Credit Card.</p>",

The initial 7,500 points after $1,000 in three months is nice if you plan to use your card for everyday purchases.  $1,000 is a lot to spend in 3 months but you are planning on spending it anyways, the $100 towards travel is nice.  The interest rate on this card is pretty high if you are able to get a lower interest card.  My Quick Silver Cash Rewards credit card from Capital One offers competitive incentives with a lower starting interest rate of 12.9%.  The Blue sky starts at 17.24% APR. Another positive of the Blue Sky card is that it has no annual fee and 0% balance transfers for 15 months.</p>",

Other cards like the Wal-Mart Credit Card also offer deals like that with a 6 month no interest rate, but I've never seen one with one as long as 15 months that this Blue Cash card offers. The rewards for using the card at US supermarkets is great too because everyone has to shop at the supermarket. It's a card that can be helpful to everyone.</p>",

This credit card is similar to the Bank of America credit card, where you get cash back from grocery stores. The bank of America gives you 2% on grocery stores, whereas the Blue cash gives you 3%. I use this credit card for gas and grocery stores. The points accumulate fast when you use the blue cash everyday card for your day to day expenses. The reward of getting 100 reward dollars after spending $1,000 in the first three months is very doable too.</p>",

There aren't any crazy fees that you have to watch out for and the APR rates are pretty close to the other credit cards you could get today. Even the late fee is about standard which is great. It's an American Express which is great because they are always so easy to work with. Their customer service is wonderful and you know that you are always going to be able to work things out if there is a problem.</p>",

Never, ever use a prepaid card that requires a monthly fee when there are so many out there that are free of charge. A good example of an absolutely terrible prepaid debit is the Upside debit. You could be paying up to 4.95 a month on this card and you have to pay for customer service. Utterly ridiculous. The Serve debit is far better. You do have to pay ATM fees, but I don't think that can really be avoided. If someone knows of a prepaid card that gets around that, let me know. I think perhaps one drawback is not every where accepts American Express. That may require more ATM withdraws than you would otherwise have to make with another prepaid card. All and all, I still think this is a good option if you are interested in getting a prepaid, which is something I always recommend.</p>",

Another card I recently looked at, and actually liked, was the Discover More, but it offered \"only\" a 12 month intro rate of 0%. This one has it beat by 3 months. The cash rewards of 6% at US supermarkets is a really nice deal I think. I make most of my meals at home and spend most of my food money buying groceries. This would be a good card for a family who does a lot of grocery shopping. Here again is a variable rate that could potentially fluctuate nearly 10% though. Also, there is a max penalty of 27.24%. You have to be careful, but I suppose that should be said about any credit card. All in all, I think this is a not a bad card. I still recommend looking into your local Credit Union before you take the plunge on a major credit card company.</p>",

I love the initial bonus points (bummer that you have to spend 1,000 but doing that in three months should be all that difficult). It's like they just give you a 100 dollar statement credit on travel right away, which is nothing that any person would turn down. Again, they have the 1 to 1 ratio on points to the dollar, which is a little disappointing based on the rest of the card, but it is still good. The only other card that was/is like this is the Capital One credit card that offered a ton of miles (the double miles challenge) but it was just a temporary thing...the Blue Sky from American Express looks to be a bit more permanent. Loving the fact that there's no annual fee either. Great card and it'll probably end up being a staple in your wallet, too.</p>",

This is a major plus for the American Express Green Card if you do a lot of online shopping like I do. This card does have an annual fee after the first year, which is $95 and I do not like that at all. I do not believe any card should have an annual fee and is the biggest negative to the American Express Green Card. It comes with purchase protection so that you are not reliable for any fraud if your card is stolen, which is very nice as some cards make you pay for this. If you do a lot of online shopping to earn or use reward points and do not mind an annual fee, the American Express Green Card is a great choice for a charge card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've always liked American express cards, after having many nightmares with other credit card companies customer service and having to wait on hold for hours to get my issues settled, only to end up being very disappointed in the end, it's a breath of fresh air to deal with american express customer service. No problems ever with them. That said, the Blue Sky from American Express card is great in other ways too. The points are easy to earn and you get a great APR and usually no APR in the beginning. It is kind of hard to get approved for as you need pretty good credit, but if you can get it, definitely do so. The no annual fee makes this a no brainer in my book.</p>",

The site to manage the card online is very well designed, allowing you to add users to your account and manage their spending limits easily. It's a nice feature I haven't seen offered by other prepaid credit card companies. Of course, this is an american express card so customer service is going to be great. This is a good prepaid card if you're in the market for one.</p>",

This card is decent if you are looking for a prepaid card. The best thing about it is there are no fees, where as some prepaid cards over load you with unnecessary fees and try to rip you off, this card isn't like that. The customer service is also top notch. Highly recommended for a prepaid card.</p>",

For example, when you enroll in direct deposit through your work, you get access to thousand of ATM for free, which is a great feature. In addition, if you travel a lot like myself, the 'no foreign exchange fee' will be a godsend in many occasions. You also get a robust and professional customer service, and online banking tools (including a mobile app!). The feature that sold me was the purchase protection for up to 3 months after you buy a product and it gets damaged or stolen during that period, which is something that my U.S. Bank prepaid card did not offer!</p>",

Like always, the Blue Cash Preferred comes with a 0% intro APR for 15 months.  The late fees are not that bad either, at only $35 per month. American Express has always been lenient on payments and the Blue Cash Preferred gives you a 25 day grace period. Overall, I would recommend this credit card to anyone.</p>",

It offers a nice 15 months of no Interest then when the interest does go up its only to 12.99% that's not bad at all considering what I'm paying now. This is not a card I will hang onto for every but for me I think it suits me just fine.</p>",

With the very minimal fees and extreme ease of set-up, I'm really having a hard time seeing where you can go wrong with this card.  I picked up my Bluebird setup kit in a Walmart for $5, loaded some money onto it right there at the cash register, and then went home and activated it online from my computer.  The temporary card can be used as a debit card anywhere that American Express is accepted, until your permanent card arrives in the mail.  All in all, Bluebird is a very cost efficient and easy option when it comes to prepaid cards.</p>",

No activation, free transactions, and even free ATM usage with a direct deposit. How is there any competition?! And this card even has purchase protection, something not commonly seen on Prepaid cards - 50,000 in a single calendar year! If you want a prepaid card, look no further, the Bluebird Prepaid is everything you wanted.</p>",

The hefty $175 dollar fee makes it nearly unaffordable for most people, but this is definitely a business card. No preset spending limit makes it a great card for any size business though, except that payment must be paid every month with this card. So if your company can afford it, this card makes a great card to put your balance on. There's no fee the first year either, and the rewards program is pretty good. Compared to a Capital One Spark Business, that card allows you to rack up a balance, but this one has no preset spending limit. I think this card is quite good if your business can afford to use it.</p>",

You cannot use it as a debit card. The only time the pin function works is to draw cash out of an ATM. Charges can only be run as a credit transaction, and unfortunately, there are many places that do not accept American Express. Further, there are several places that will only accept debit. One should be able to access their funds using a pin number with this card but we can\u2019t! We have also had issues making deposits. We have gone to places, including Walmart, that according to the website had an ATM that accepted deposits and found that that ATM did not exist at that location. We have tried to use the smart phone and make deposits by uploading a picture, but the app has crashed three of our smart phones and does not work. Nor is there an option to scan the check and upload it with your computer. This card is completely lacking in options and service and unfortunately since it is an American Express card which is not accepted everywhere is no longer useful to us. We have changed our direct deposit and will no longer be using the bluebird card.</p>",

This is a card to consider if you need an alternative to banking or simply want an American Express card without signing up for the full blown credit card.

With the large point bonuses on gas and airfare rates and the need to spend 5k in the first 3 months to activate the full bonus points, it's obvious who this card is intended for. Also, it's definitely a business card and not suited to the individual as the balance must be paid off before at the beginning of every month. Unlike every other card I have had (including my Oklahoma State Alumni card) this has no pre-set spending limit. So you're free to \"grow your business\". Oh happy day.</p>",

They just don't trust banks anymore and don't like the high interest rates on bank cards, so they choose the prepaid route and a lot of them have said that they've tried multiple cards but the Bluebird Prepaid Card is the one they like the most. I love the fact that activation, balance checking and everything else is free compared to cards like the Mango Prepaid Mastercard, which charges $4 simply for activation. I would recommend the Bluebird Prepaid Card to everyone just based off of the word-of-mouth that I've heard from my immediate family members and friends. It seems to be one of the best options out there for prepaid cards, period.</p>",

However, there are some positive things to owning a card from AmEx- I have personally found it the easiest card to manage, simply from not wanting to spend as much needless money on a \"fancier\" card, you could say. Might sound silly but human psychology is a wonderful thing. Merchants also look for American Express when you're buying things- you'll probably feel more valuble as a customer. The added addition of being able to use \"points\" for flights and such was wonderful. I was able to visit my family back west a little more!</p>",

        "content": "<p>I\u2019ll tell you what, I would feel pretty silly carrying around a Farmville Prepaid Card in my wallet.  I mean imagine whipping that out to pay for a meal at a nice restaurant.  On the other hand, I always preach evaluating cards on their terms rather than their branding, so I have to practice that.  The Farmville prepaid card has very few fees, which might make it immediately more appealing to you than many of the fee-laden cards out there like the Suze Orman Card.  But you have to consider how expensive the card would be practically, and if you\u2019re someone who makes a few ATM withdrawals per month, the fees could add up.  You only get free ATM withdrawal per month, and after that you\u2019ll likely have to shell out around $4 for each transaction (the Farmville Card\u2019s $2.00 ATM fee, plus an owner surcharge).<br /><br /><br>So, if you are using a prepaid card as a replacement checking account, you can likely find a less expensive option.  I like the GreenDot card since it does not charge a monthly fee when you deposit at least $1,000 per month (you could easily meet this requirement by directly depositing your paycheck) and offers free ATM withdrawals.  If you\u2019re using the card as a teaching tool for your child, well, the Farmville Card could be a decent choice since it has low fixed costs.  I would probably just get them the standard American Express Prepaid Card though because it has the same fees and does not bring the Farmville aspect into things.  I would be nervous that my kids would overspend just to earn some stupid in-game rewards.  I suppose that could be a quality teaching opportunity though because I would just laugh if they tried to hit me up for more cash!<br /><br /><br>Ultimately, the Farmville Prepaid Debit Card is decent, but that\u2019s not because it\u2019s Farmville branded, it\u2019s because its terms mirror the standard Amex Prepaid Card.  The Farmville aspect doesn\u2019t really bring much to the table, aside from the dubious lure of earning virtual rewards on your real money.</p>",

For only $25 per year, I've had my own American Express card, which comes with fantastic benefits and unparalleled customer service. I use my Zync everywhere I go and it has never let me down since. This card helps control spending because you cannot carry a balance over to the next month and need to pay in full, which I do like. The card also looks great and makes people look twice each time I use it. I like the fact I have so many benefits, such as rental insurance, extended warranty, and product protection. Product protection ensures that I'll be reimbursed if an item I purchase gets damaged, lost or stolen! No other card offers the benefits American Express does. I would highly recommend the Zync card to anyone looking to step foot in the door with AMEX!</p>",

There have been a few times where I was late in paying in full, and Amex has reasonable late fee terms and prices. It is also nice that I can use my Reward Points with my Amazon.com account in order to purchase small items. I highly recommend this card to anyone looking for an alternative to a debit card, or just a way to build their credit.</p>",

Not only do you receive the benefits of having an American Express card (outstanding customer service!) the annual fee is low and you rack up membership rewards points very quickly! You don't have to worry about carrying a balance because it's PIF every month. My favorite part of the Zync card, is the customizable packs. You can tailor special \"packs\" to your card, some free, some with a monthly fee, that can double or even triple your reward points. Could be great, for example, to add the restaurant pack to double points at restaurants, if you eat out a lot. Highly recommend American Express and the Zync card!</p>",

The points can be redeemed for airline miles, hotel points, retail merchandise, as well as being able to pay for travel and part of your bill with the points. What I like most is the different money back policies they have. This card offers extended return times (90 days) versus typical stores which you only have 30 days and they also offer replacement items for anything you bought on your card within the past 180 days that has been broken or stolen. Overall I am pleased with the card and service.</p>",

Another feature I love is the fact that American Express Simply Cash will fight for you if you have trouble with a merchant. Over the five years I have had it, they have won me two settlements with merchants over lost/defective items and overcharges to the card for services rendered. Keep in mind that one thing you should always do with any card is pay off the balance each cycle. The interest is a killer. But that is just common sense, right?</p>",

        "content": "<p>The first thing you need to know when shopping for a business credit card is that your personal credit standing, not your business\u2019, will be the most important factor in the application process.  In other words you don\u2019t need to start at the bottom of the totem pole if you are starting a new business.  The reason for this is that credit card companies hold small business owners liable for business credit card use and report use to their personal credit reports.  That means if you have excellent credit the American Express SimplyCash Business Credit Card will be an option.  Whether it\u2019s a good one is another story entirely.  The Amex Simply Cash Business Credit Card offers 5% cash back on wireless services and office supplies, 3% cash back on gas, and 1% on everything else.  Simply Cash Business cardholders also automatically get 3-10% savings on purchases business expenses from Fedex, Hertz, and OfficeMax.  You also get 0% on purchases for 6-12 months.  Sounds pretty good, huh?<br /><br /><br>Sure does, but you still need to ask yourself two important questions, is this the most rewarding card and can I use it for all company spending.  Issuers can still change interest rates on business credit cards at will, which means if you need to use a credit card for funding purposes, you should get a personal credit card.  You should still use a business credit card for everyday expenses though, which is where the American Express Simply Cash Business Card comes into play.  Looking at other business rewards cards it does appear to be a competitive offer.  It really depends on your company\u2019s spending habits though.  For example, the Ink Bold from Chase offers 5 points per dollar on your first $50,000 in business expenses each year and has an initial bonus, so if you spend less than $50k each year on office supplies, wireless services, etc., it might be a better option.  Neither it nor the Amex Simple Cash has an annual fee in the first year, although the Bold has a $95 fee beginning in the second year.  I\u2019d recommend looking around a bit to make sure you\u2019ve found the right card, but if you want simple, straightforward rewards, aren\u2019t concerned with travel rewards, and office supplies, wireless services, and gas are three of your company\u2019s biggest expenses, the Simple Cash Business Credit Card from American Express is likely the way to go.</p>",

The most bang for your buck comes when you use it towards travel related purchases but if you are not planning on traveling you could also use your points towards gift cards and cash if you prefer that. During the months of November and December they even had gift cards available at discounted point for many restaurants. I've had this card for about 5 years now and I have used points for over $400 in gift cards, Free airline ticket from Miami to Atlanta, and usually able to take $100 off most of my travel expenses using points. Like David Kauffman stated before me they have started to offer other deals. The last one I used was a $5 statement credit when you purchase $30 at olive garden. Over all this is one card worth having for the special deal. I would just recommend logging on to your account often to take advantage of everything.</p>",

For example, sync your AMEX account with your Twitter, and you can buy stuff through Twitter with your card!  They had a deal where you could buy a $25 AMEX Sync card for $15, which is basically free money!  They also have deals through their Facebook App where they do things such as \"Buy $100 at Store X and get a $10 statement credit\".

For me Blue Sky from American Express is almost like another limb. I use it everyday and I don\u2019t know what I would do without it. Every meal it eat, every trip I plan, and all the gas I buy is usually with this card. Likewise I also reap a lot of rewards benefits. Every couple thousand rewards points that I accrue the more options I am offered. Whether its a travel voucher or a gift card of some sort.</p>",

The customer service is top notch (the few times I have actually had to deal with them, it was certainly not an unpleasant experience), the rates are fantastic and the rewards are excellent as well. Having no blackout dates is also something I really like about this card. I hope to have this card for the foreseeable future and I would recommend it to any family or friends interested in getting a new credit card.</p>",

I do wish this card was acceptable in more places,  but that would be the only complaint.  The rewards add up very fast and American Express always treats you as a prized customer rather than someone they are trying to get money out of.  When its time to redeem your rewards they walk you through the process and make sure you are getting the best available for your points.  The no black outs is not a gimmick as I have never had a problem redeeming my points for travel.</p>",

I do have good credit, and despite that, the rate is fairly high, but better than plenty others I've seen. You really need to pay it off monthly to get the good deals from the rewards. What really sold me on it was the fact that there are no fees and the rewards are pretty decent. So many other cards you are paying a yearly fee to get similar rewards, so you really win on that point with Blue Sky. Also, the rewards are extremely easy to redeem. When you hit 7,500 points and want to receive a $100 travel credit, you just make a selection online and click the travel/hotel/car you purchased that you want it applied to...and voila! The money is there. There are also several gift card/statement credit options. I recently ordered a gift card and it arrived two days later! If you are on top of paying off your credit card and using this frequently, the rewards definitely make it a good option for a card!</p>",

I recently dined out and an untrustworthy member of the restaurant staff took my credit card information, went to a neighboring establishment, and made several purchases. These purchases didn't raise the red flag as illegitimate/fraudulent because they were small and local. They could easily have been mine. Nevertheless, when I reported it to American Express, they quickly deducted the charges and launched an investigation! They even demanded the merchant in question show proof of signature. I was amazed at their thoroughness, and how quickly they believed me and took action, rather than questioning the validity of my story.</p>",

There is no annual fee and the interest rate is pretty decent compared to what is being offered nowadays. It offers online statements and payments. The website is incredibly easy to navigate and I also get monthly reminders when my bill is due. This is huge for me as I am definitely the type to let these details slip my mind from time to time.</p>",

What I liked about it when I got it was that it had many of the perks of an American Express card, but without the yearly fee.  I also was about to collect enough points in the first couple of months to be able to get a $300 credit on a flight I was taking, which was very helpful at the time.  Paying the card online took a bit of setting up to do since there was an issue with the website not remembering my username and password combination, but once all that was straightened out, I've had no trouble with it.  They give you plenty enough notice, via email, to get your bills paid on time as well.  I've never had to use it to withdraw cash, so I can't comment on the ease or difficulty of that.  The downsides to it are that due to the lack of a monthly fee, the 'perks' that come with an AmEx card are drastically cut down.  And after the promotional period ends, points for travel or cash back are very slow to add up.</p>",

I felt so modern and up with the times when I carried it around and used it.<br /><br /><br>Unfortunately the downside to American Express is that they don't tend to work with you if you are having difficulties. While I loved the card I had to pay off the balance and close it, and my other two Amex cards, when I went through a tight stretch because they were completely unsympathetic and offered me no way of help. Fortunately I was able to find a way out on my own and close the accounts, but strangely enough I still miss this card!</p>",

From the very moment I swipe the credit card, to the moment I make the payment, it's all been an enjoyable and genuinely positive experience. I am also very grateful for all the efforts that Amex has taken in ensuring that the card is not only dependable, but also protected from potential fraudulent charges. The customer service has been exceptional. I have been treated with both respect and courtesy in those rare occasions in which I\u2019ve had to speak to a representative. The rewards are also another great perk; being able to redeem those points for Amex gift cards has been wonderful since we don't really get that many opportunities to travel often. All in all, having this card has been a very positive experience.</p>",

They are the only card accepted at Costco, so if you can't pay debit, in that regard they are a convenient card to have.  I, however, do not recommend American Express to anyone.  After being a cardholder for over 10 years, never being late on a payment, American Express saw fit to randomly drop my available credit limit by over $15,000.  This drop in the credit limit made it look as though I was nearly maxed out on this card which then hurt my credit score quite a bit.  As I continued to pay down the balance, American Express kept lowering the limit by $1000.  Over a 1 year period I went from a $25,000 limit to a $6000 limit with absolutely no warning or explanation from American Express.  I have not closed the account but I do try my very best not to use the card.  I'm sorry, I would not recommend American Express to anyone.</p>",

I feel like the rewards on this card aren't as great on other cards.  The best deal is redeeming 7500 points for $100 in airfare credit, but that's it.  Other cards let me do cash back, gift cards, things like that and redeem points at a much higher percentage back.  American Express also would only give me a $2,000 limit, while other cards gave me as much as $15,000.<br /><br /><br>Overall it's a good card to have if you need to pay with AMEX like a place like CostCo, since there is no annual fee.  But you are better off with other cards for every day purchases that offer you a higher cash back.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I\u2019m not quite sure why people apply for the Blue Sky from American Express Credit Card.  Maybe it\u2019s due to American Express\u2019 good reputation.  Maybe it\u2019s because it has a pretty name.  Or maybe it\u2019s actually because it offers 0% on purchases for 12 months and 1 rewards point for every dollar spent.  If it\u2019s the latter, you need to understand that neither of these perks is that noteworthy.  Why?  One percent across all purchases is pretty much the standard in the rewards credit card genre, and most of the upper echelon cards offer up even better rewards on certain popular spending categories in addition to that.  Also, a 12 month 0% purchase APR is decent, but there are a lot of cards offering better deals.  Take, for example, the Citi Simplicity Card.  It offers 0% on purchases for 21 months AND 0% on transfers for the same length of time.<br /><br /><br>So, which cards in particular would be better choices than the American Express Blue Sky Credit Card?  If you want rewards and don\u2019t have any particular spending categories that dominate your monthly statements, I\u2019d go with the Capital One Venture Card or the Capital One Cash Credit Card, as the former offers what amounts to 2% cash back as long as you redeem miles for travel-related purchases and the latter offers 1.5% cash back across all purchases.  If you tend to spend a lot at gas stations, department stores, dining, etc., then you can find a card offering extra rewards on your biggest spending category and save more than you would with the Blue Sky American Express Credit Card.  When it comes to interest rates, the aforementioned Citicard is obviously a much better deal than the Blue Sky.  The bottom line is that excellent credit, which the Blue Sky Credit Card requires for approval, is like a golden ticket in today\u2019s market, and getting a card like the Blue Sky from American Express would just be a waste of potential.</p>",

One of the great things about the card is the $0 introductory Fee and after saving up points you can use them for shopping at some of your favorite stores and restaurants. Also the customer service over at American Express has been fantastic, I think they are one of the best in that regard. One downside of that card is after the first year you have to pay, so keep that in mind. Despite that, this is still a card very much worth getting.</p>",

The reason for this preference is simple-- of all the credit cards around American Express Gold fared better across the board.  Firstly, they excel in customer service. Not only that, they are hassle free, accepted widely, and the rewards points accumulate very quickly. I admit I have a cash back rewards card but I don\u2019t feel as if I'm earning very much.  Pennies accumulate with every purchase, and I end up spending them on the next purchase.  With cash back I am awarded a gift card for a dinner or other gifts that I can actually see feel or taste.  This works better for my psyche and leaves me feeling even better about AMEX and the world around me.</p>",

There are a ton of perks with having this card, such as the points for spending system, and flyer miles (for those who travel a lot). While these perks are definitely a plus, I have to be honest in saying that the annual fee, although free the first year, is a little high for my tastes. If you are one to use your credit card anywhere and everywhere (especially to rack up those points to spend), then maybe the fee isn't too bad. Asides from that, I've dealt with American Express customer service a few times and have to say that they provide better service experience than most of my other cards I have. I do recommend getting this card, especially if you are one that loves using points to shop!</p>",

I would have loved to keep it if not for an unexpected reversal of fortune. One thing with American Express is that once you have fallen out of grace, there is no turning back. You are forever blacklisted. I found that out too late.  I had a good run with it, though.</p>",

The customer service is exceptional and I am able to get a real person on the phone within minutes. You don't have to go through a million prompts and their customer service reps are helpful and honestly, just nice people. Amex provides travel insurance which covers you  if your bags are lost and provides insurance for your rental car (saving you money!). My favorite benefit is the return protection that Amex offers. How many times have you purchased a piece of clothing just for it to fall apart after wearing it a few times? If this has ever happened to you (like it has to me), this is the card for you. The store won't take back your item? No problem! Just file a claim with American Express and they will refund you! The expensive shoes you bought kill your feet after wearing them? Again, not a problem! Amex has you covered. The annual fee I pay definitely is worth the benefits I receive from this card. Thanks Amex for the outstanding service!</p>",

Unlike a credit card, it is required that you pay the full amount each month, but for people who do this anyways, this is a great card. The 15,000 bonus after spending $1500 in the first month is a great help, but the most amazing thing about this card is the benefits of being a Gold card member. To name some, they include roadside assistance, acceptance of returns that stores will no longer take, insurance when travelling using your American Express card and much more. Holding an American Express Gold Card in your wallet is much more than a credit card, it really does make you feel like you are a member or something.</p>",

It is wonderful for travel, car rentals, luxury purchases, etc. It also  carries a built in insurance plan to insure most rental cars and probably other rentals as well.  Mine comes with a rewards program where points accumulate very quickly.  Some may wait to accumulate thousands of points for larger prizes but my method is to frequently redeem my points for restaurant gift cards. As opposed to cash back, rewards redemption gives me that feeling of truly being pampered by AMEX at a nice restaurant-- on them. The annual fee is $125 but the peace of mind I get in return with this card is worth every penny.  You can't carry a monthly balance, but I like the traditional AMEX way of paying it off every month with no interest. My experience with customer service has been nothing short of professional. Overall, this is one of the top cards around.</p>",

I also am not thrilled with the yearly fee.  The first year they waive the fee, but after that it is $125 annually.  One great thing about this company is their excellent customer service.  I have called a few times with questions and concerns and have always spoken with friendly and knowledgeable staff that were able to address all of my issues.

Secondly, American Express has an excellent policy regarding stolen or lost credit cards. A little over a year ago I lost my credit card and didn't realize it was gone. A month later I got my American Express bill and saw charges for 500 that I had no idea about. I called American Express and the charges were immediately reversed. This type of outstanding service is far from what I experienced from other card companies.

I think it\u2019s better than most credit cards, but, let\u2019s face it, these companies make money somehow, and that somehow means high late fees. But this is a charge card so at least there isn\u2019t any interest accrued over time. You have to pay back the balance in full every month. <br /><br /><br>I think AMEX is a little out of date, from the era of traveler\u2019s cheques. If you aren\u2019t a business traveler, racking up tons of points and rewards, it\u2019s easier to use your Visa or MasterCard debit card issued by your bank.  Plus, they are accepted  at more places than American Express. <br /><br>Overall, the membership fee is too high if you\u2019re not a business traveler, and you may actually pay more in membership fees than rewards you get back. I cancelled my card a year ago and don\u2019t regret it.</p>",

The customer service reps are beyond parallel in the industry and they levels of fraud protection, responsiveness and rewards are much better than Visa's, for example.<br /><br /><br>The number of places you can use your card in are somewhat limited, but think about it as a loyalty club. This is not a card to buy your groceries (well, you can, but that's not its main use). This is the ideal travelers card. No lockups, fast service, robust online systems and low waiting times if you need to reach a customer service rep. I'm very happy with my American Express experience and would gladly recommend it to anyone else.</p>",

I am forced to pay the monthly payments each month, I can't just put it off for another time. For me this is a good thing since I can never get behind on my payments. The interest rate for this card is pretty decent, and hasn't really effected me so far. I have only gone over a limit once and the card froze up, I called customer service and the explained to me what happened. In return I learned what kind of limit I had as well as to never do that again. I have been told there is no annual fee for the first year, which I find to be really good. Overall so far I have had no real problems with this card, and would highly recommend it to anyone that can manage to get it.</p>",

What I love about the AMEX card is that you have the safety to purchase anything you want, the drawback being you have to pay the entire amount every month. I feel like this card keeps you more honest about your spending. Also the rewards are amazing, thus far I have booked two round trip vacations to the Caribbean with my reward points. Also I was able to set up my other family members on a shared plan which is amazing at monitoring our family expenditures.</p>",

Anytime I have a question or need to get a hold of them, they are always very friendly and responsive. I don't have that feeling that they are rushing to get me off the phone, whereas other problems I've had with my other credit cards usually result in an unpleasant experience. Never once have I had that negative feeling with American Express. They tend to go the extra mile in security as well. If I spend a lot of money in a short amount of time, they call and verify that I made the purchases to confirm that my card has not been stolen. Over the last 4 years of owning this card, the only issue I ever have is coming across those few places that won't take them. Other than that, if and when I CAN use my American Express card, I do.</p>",

They also have some of the best rewards items of any of the major credit cards.  Don't let the annual fee scare you away from trying this card.

I got a great pan set thanks to American Express, a camera and a DVD recorder. The service is just amazing. In one trip to Brazil they copied the card number and immediately froze the account after suspecting that two purchases weren't ours, I share the same account with my husband.

One of the biggest perks for me was the points program they offer.  There is a wide variety of options in how to redeem your points and I have never had anything but excellent service and great experiences when I redeem mine.  I have booked entire Hawaiian vacations, airfare included, using my points which to me is a huge perk!  Another of the perks for me was I was able to get a personal card when I left the firm and have my rewards transferred to that account.  I pay my balance off each and every single month as this card requires.  I like that there is one flat fee for the year and no fee the first year.  In order to get the most benefit from this card it is important to always make your payments on time, as they will get you with the late fees.  However, as long as that isn't a problem for you I would highly recommend this card!  It is important to remember there are still some retailers who don't accept Amex so I would also have a second card or make sure to have a debit card handy as well.</p>",

Everyone knows if you are carrying the AEGC you are in the upper most bracket of valuable customers and they best get on their game. I never had a problem in over 12 years of using American Express. We had a few issues with items that arrived broken in the post and American Express helped us get credit and resolve the issues with the shipper. That goes to my previous point. When I had similar issues using an HSBC card, the shipper wanted to haggle and hassle. When we used the American Express card we never got any grief. That is why I truly believe that the American Express Gold Card carries a hefty bit of clout for the consumer to throw around if need be.</p>",

I have typically received 2-3X points for purchases at both low end (Sears) and high end (Neiman Marcus) retailers.  Another nice feature of the card is being able to use points directly on Amazon.com.  While it's less than the typical 1% redemption rate, it is still a nice to have around the holidays.<br /><br /><br>The one thing I do not like about the card is the annual membership fee.  It is very high, and they do not let you use points (at a 1% conversion rate) to cover it.  If they let you do that, the card would be nearly perfect.<br /><br /><br>It's definitely a great card, and I would highly recommend it to people who tend to put a lot of spend on their credit cards.</p>",

I just booked a free ticked for my daughter to travel to France this October.  I like that American Express is accepted everywhere and that it is a recognizable brand credit card when traveling abroad.  I also know that American Express has alerted me to unusual activity and fraud on my account and they removed those charges.  It has also helped me with disputed payments on some items.

The American Express Gold Card is readily accepted by all of my vendors and even my utility companies. Unfortunately, I had a problem one month where I had been overcharged - two charges for the same shipment. Instead of waiting for a response from the vendor like I have experienced with other credit cards, American Express immediately credited my account. The company sets a high standard for qualifying, but this works in favor of a customer like me because the company can stand behind the customer's word. Very satisfied with AMEX and hope to open a business account with them in the near future.</p>",

On the plus side, American Express is a great company, and having their army of customer support agents at your side is a pretty great feeling. The system is set up so ensure a great experience from the customer standpoint. However, the cons are more practical in nature. The annual fee is $125, which is a pretty high fee to deal with American Express. In addition, not all companies will take American Express, so having another card as a backup plan is a good idea. If you're in a financial position where this isn't as important to you, I would suggest applying for this card. Having it in your pocket when the need arises is certainly comforting.</p>",

No lie, I get treated excellently.  Even one time after I got laid off and was having trouble making payments, they were so kind and patient.  They worked with me and when I got my new position, we resolved everything.  I am 100% thrilled with this company and their service.  The annual fee - I could do without, but I guess that's how the get the training they get.</p>",

When I first got the card I was worried about having to pay off the monthly balance every month because I didn't have to do this with my old credit card. After using it for so long though I can honestly say I LOVE that feature. It has helped keep myself on top of my finances even better than before. I also NEVER overspend now that I have this card because I KNOW I do have to pay it off. The only thing I don't like about this card would be that not all retailers do accept it like my old VISA. So, I try to remember those retailers when I'm out and about so that I can make sure to either brign cash or my debit! (:</p>",

I spoke to customer service on a few different occasions and seemed to be taken care of in a quick fashion.  Maybe it's just me but I feel that the annual fee is a little steep.

Sure they may not be accepted everywhere, but really most of the places are starting to accept them now and I always use my AmEx whenever I have a chance to. Their Customer Service is top-notch, I had actually bought an espresso machine online and it turned out the seller tried to scam me and didn't ship the item. I quickly called AmEx and their Reps handled it quickly and got the charge-back back on my account. I actually feel more protected with AmEx where-as other credit card companies just have me thinking about interest rates. If I ever go down AmEx would be the last credit card I'll cancel.

I was excited to learn of this policy and especially excited to learn that it did not involve any extra effort on my part-the insurance was included with the card. The process for receiving reimbursement for my stolen iphone was easy and painless, and I will probably continue to buy large purchases with an American Express card. <br /><br /><br>The downside to American Express, however, is that not many business accept the card. I have had to keep another credit card with me for dining out and retailers that do not accept American Express. However my card works with almost all online purchases so it has not been too much of a burden. <br /><br /><br>Overall I am very happy with my American Express card and will continue to use it.</p>",

It is a credit card for consumers with excellent credit; it has a very nominal annual fee and offers 25,000 bonus miles, which you get in 1,000 increments each month you make a purchase with the card for the first 25 months. Credit card companies often offer rewards in this manner because it ensures that their customers will make purchases and they will get interchange revenue. This Card also gives you 2 miles for each $1 you charge across all purchases, making it similar to the popular Capital One Venture Card, particularly since you can redeem for travel on any airline.

I wanted to pay the amount using two checking accounts. I paid 250 by one account and when I tried to pay the remaining, got a message that it needs a minimum of 48 hours to process another transaction. I made another purchase of 800$ and with a day the card was locked and I got call from Customer care asking me to pay the entire amount immediately.<br /><br>I got so frustrated with the behavior of the customer care executive. I have never had such a ugly situation in my life. <br /><br>I also had an incident a few years ago that made me question whether to keep Amex. I had a restaurant double charge me and disputed the charge with Amex. But they said only if the owner agrees the charge is a mistake will I keep the credit. This despite I had never disputed a charge before and I spend thousands a month on American Express without incident.<br /><br>Amex's investigating time period takes so long I worried the restaurant owner would no longer have the nights register receipts by that time. So bottom line is I went to the restaurant myself and talked to the owner as soon as possible while the receipts were still available. He issued me a credit, no thanks to American Express.</p>",

The card has no preset spending limit. However, if you decide to make large purchases with the card within the first few months of owning it, Amex may decide to suspend your card. I had an issue with them when I used the card to upgrade the laptops for my office. It was a 10k purchase and Amex decided to suspend the card. I had to supply the correct information including taxes and my employment history to continue to keep the card. In addition, they also did not want to waive the first years fee even though it is what they agreed to. However, they complied and waived the first year and decided to grant me back the card.<br /><br /><br>After all of that, the card is great to have. It is excellent for rewards and it gives you an incentive not to over spend since you have to pay the bill in full each month. So far the card has been good to me and I get great perks and gift cards from them for spending all the time. If you need a flexible charge card, this isn't the card for you. If you pay on time and want rewards, this is perfect.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Issue with charge card for beginner is exactly what you stated.  No preset spending limit. This has more issue than \"let's see how much amex is going to give me if I keep spending\".  It also means the % of credit usage isn't reported properly to credit bureaus.  Say a normal cc like amex spg.  I have preset limit of $20k. If I spend 1k,   BOTH  max limit 20k and 1k spending is reported to credit bureau. So they will be able to see that I am not maxing out my limit and using the card properly.    <br /><br /><br>For charge card, however,   the max is unknown, and isn't reported. So credit bureau won't be able to see my credit utilization. In fact, the highest monthly spending becomes the so called \"max\" for that card. (which is the reason why they suggest you take one month to put all your spending on a single charge card to artificially set high credit limit for that card). <br /><br /><br>now getting back to THIS specific card.  One word.   DON'T.   amex has premier gold that is UBER better than this card (50 bux more per yr, but totally worth it, if you are someone who are consider getting this card anyway).  only reason I can ever see getting this card is if I am not going to fly a lot next year, and my first free year for amex premier gold is nearing end, just to keep my amex reward points alive.</p>",

I mean, I get that you need excellent credit to get them most of the time, and you have to pay your bill in full every month, but isn\u2019t that a good thing?  If you\u2019re going to get a rewards card, you should be paying its bill in full anyway, so why not at least include charge cards in your search to see if any offer the best rewards available on your biggest expenses?  American Express controls a large portion of the charge card market, which means that the American Express Gold Card is an option you really should keep open.<br /><br /><br>Pros<br /><br /><br>-\tThe Amex Gold Card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee in the first year (most charge cards charge relatively high annual fees to compensate for the added rewards they provide \u2013 come to think of it, this might be a con).<br /><br /><br>-\tExclusive access to sporting events, concerts and shows (charge cards are sort of known for offering \u201caccess\u201d and \u201cunique experiences\u201d in addition to the normal points, miles or cash back common with rewards credit cards, but aside from maybe getting the chance to buy tickets before the general public, what does \u201cexclusive access\u201d really mean? )<br /><br /><br>Cons<br /><br /><br>-\tThe American Express Gold Charge Card has No Preset Spending Limit.   While I used to think that this meant you could spend as much as you wanted each month, it actually just means that Amex basically makes your limit up as it goes along, you never know what it is, and you can hurt your credit score because of high credit line utilization or something along those lines.<br /><br /><br>-\t$125 second year annual fee; If you\u2019re going to charge a high annual fee, there had better be some pretty darn good rewards to justify it.  That means the Amex Gold Card\u2019s exclusive access better be top notch.<br /><br /><br>When you get down to it, you might find cheaper credit and charge card options that give you more than the American Express Gold does.  But if you are a big fan of sporting events, concerts or shows, you might not.  I\u2019d therefore carefully consider your priorities and maybe give Amex a call to hear more about the Gold Card\u2019s rewards before making a decision.</p>",

I'm new to prepaid cards so I'm not sure if it's normal for it to take more then 2 days to reload but it has for us.  We have had our bank account linked to this card and verified, yet still takes 2 or more business days for the funds to be available.  <br /><br /><br>ATM fees are a bit steep, however you do get one \"Free\" withdraw per month.  Free as in AMEX will not charge you however ATM fees may still apply based on whatever bank owns the ATM.  Also, worth noting are said ATM fees, AMEX charges their own fee, and it is stacked on top of whatever ATM fee there is, so keep that in mind if you ever need to use the ATM.<br /><br /><br>Overall, great card if ATM use isn't on top of your list.</p>",

That's just awesome. Then, after that just two dollars which is much less then any of of the other Prepaids I've dealt with in the past. AmEx really has that going for them, the truly minimal fee thing. Honestly, this is my fave of my Prepaids and I'd recommend it to those who don't plan to use when dining out. Oh, and their customer service is great.

Overall, I would say this is a great card for yourself or a child if you want them to have access to money without putting it on a credit card.</p>",

I usually upload a few hundred dollars at a time to the account and replenish those funds once I am close to exhausting the balance. To add money I have strictly used their online banking, but it appears as though you can also do it by phone or by using direct deposit from a bank account.<br /><br /><br>The one thing that Amex will charge you for is for withdrawing funds from this account from the ATM. It is because of this that I recommend you get this card if you are looking to benefit from their great customer service or if you are looking to build your financial track record in the hopes that you will be invited to apply for an American Express Charge Card.</p>",

The kids thought it was cool until they figured out that it wasn't a charge card like the one I use and they couldn't just buy whatever and pay it back later.  It worked out okay, though, and I can schedule automatic payments to this card with my bank.  The $2500 monthly limit for this method of adding money to the card works out nicely since there's no way they're getting anywhere near that much money per month.<br /><br /><br>I like that there are very few fees, though the $2 per ATM transaction is a bit steep considering the ATM frequently also charges a similar fee for use.  It works out to about a 20% charge on a $20 bill.  The kids have pretty much stopped using cash except for emergencies.<br /><br /><br>The replacement policy is probably the best part since the kids have lost or destroyed the cards several times already.  I'm not sure how they manage to do that but the lack of access to their money for a few days because of not having a card doesn't seem to affect their ability to take the cards out of circulation.  I still haven't gotten a straight answer about how the one card got torn in half the long way.<br /><br /><br>In any case, these cards are almost perfect for what I use them for.</p>",

I applied to it online and get approved right away, and after spending $500 in less then 3 months, I got a 30,000 miles bonus, meaning $300 towards a plane ticket. With this I could get a round trip to Florida for some vacation without spending anything.  Every time I spend a dollar, I get a mile, and 2 miles for every dollar spent with Delta, oh and by the way, these miles never expire! You check your first baggage for free, saving you $25 each way, and you can share this offer with up to 9 other people traveling with you, useful when you have a big family or a lot of friends, isn\u2019t it? Also you can enjoy priority boarding. I really recommend the card and even if you are not a frequent flyer, it is always nice to save on plane tickets or hotel rooms and use the savings towards some more fun during vacation time.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have had my Gold Delta SkyMiles card for 5 years. During this time I was very pleased with the card until recently. I relocated across the country for a job, and due to this relocation was forced to try and do a short sale on my house. Other than this, my credit has always been exemplary; my payments were always made on time. I used my SkyMiles card to cover my moving expenses and promptly paid down the bill. However, because of the pending short sale on my home, my credit limit was cut by approximately 75%, I contacted customer service and they told me that they were unable to provide me with any further information. Since this time, every time that I pay down the balance on the card, my credit limit is cut to approximately $100 over my current balance. I have continued to contact customer service to try and get my limit raised, as I was using this card primarily for business travel, but they are unable to connect me with anyone that can assist me. I am continually told that I will receive as email or a letter with instructions on how to dispute the credit limit reduction, but it has been 3 months, and no email or letter has arrived. <br /><br /><br>Up until this point, it was worth it to me to have this card, and have available credit in case of emergencies. I was able to justify the high annual fee because of this. At this point, I am considering cancelling the card and paying off the remaining balance. The interest rate is high and the annual fee is high, but because I can no longer use the card to make the purchases I require for business travel, I frequently need to use my other airline rewards card that continues to provide me with the credit limit that I require.</p>",

I am a frequent flyer and the upgrade in service one gets as a result of simply being a skymiles member has be my favorite thing about the card. As for working directly with American Express, customer service has always been extremely willing to help with any questions I might have. As a college student, this is my first credit card. The staff has been very helpful and patient in teaching me how to read statements, understand billing periods, and payment deadlines. I never have to wait on the phone on hold for extended periods of time. The staff is very timely and considerate of the customers. The iPhone app for AmEx and the online services have proved extremely useful as well. I have been thoroughly please with my service. While I do feel that the skymiles program caters more to businesses than everyday citizens, simply because of how hard it is to increase skymiles, it has no doubt come in handy when I have taken numerous continental trips. I would recommend to anyone planning on getting this credit card to apply shortly after taking a Delta flight. The benefit of this is that one can put the miles earned on this flight toward the skymiles account on the credit card. I would recommend (and have recommended!) this card to numerous people, especially if you are a frequent flyer.</p>",

The card has actually turned out to be SO much more! If you travel even a little bit, this card is for you! I earn double SkyMiles on all Delta purchases, get 20% off in-flight food and beverages, get a $99 companion flight each year (which offsets the annual fee), and I get priority boarding on all Delta flights. When a flight is full and overhead space is bound to fill up, this is an amazing benefit! I was even upgraded to first class on a recent flight from Paris to JFK. Can't say for sure that it was due to having this card, but I assume that it was. I have only had to contact customer service a few times, but each time I had a good and helpful experience. I definitely recommend this card to anyone looking for a great airline miles reward card.</p>",

As with all American Express cards, there are some places that won't take it, but I'd say that 90-95% of the places that I've tried to use it have accepted it.  <br /><br /><br>I have never carried a balance on it, so I can't comment on fees or interest rates.  However, the customer service is excellent.  On two occasions, the American Express fraud prevention team has called me with questions about a recent purchase on the card, and in both cases, it was found that my card had somehow been compromised.  In both cases, American Express overnighted me a new card, including once when I was out of town.  Of course, they also removed the spurious charges.  In another case, I accidentally missed paying my bill by one day.  I called American Express, and they removed the late fee and interest charges without any issue.  <br /><br /><br>Finally, I like using this particular card because of the airline miles I accrue.  My wife and I recently flew first class to France on KLM and Air France through miles we earned on this card.  It was a dream.  I'm definitely sticking with American Express, and at least for the time being, I'm also sticking with this card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is one of the good ideas I had that turned bad over the two years I had the card.  I traveled within the United States a couple times a month on business, and flew Delta when I could.  This card initially gave me some benefits as they advertise, and I was satisfied with it.  The interest rate is very high in this time of 1% bank interest, but I didn't carry a balance and that was not a concern at the time. The waived fee for the first year and actual accumulation of miles from ordinary purchases would have had me rate the card 4.5 STARS at that time, with the only issue being some merchants not accepting American Express cards.<br /><br /><br>The second year was a different experience.  Paying the annual fee was justified by the mileage benefits and some customer service aspects having the card gave me when flying Delta.  I had 2 cancellations in Atlanta due to weather, requiring overnight stay, and this card did make the experience less stressful each time.  But in part due to those charges and delay in getting reimbursed by my company, I started having a balance on the card.<br /><br /><br>The interest rate had never affected me, but now I realized how high it really was.  I started running a balance due to some cutbacks at work, but always paid at least three times the minimum due.  One morning on a business trip I tried to used the card to pay for gasoline and it was declined.  Calling the company, they said the card had been suspended due to my credit rating, completely unrelated to my payment experience with American Express.  I had no warning of this at all.<br /><br /><br>So while the card did have the advertised benefits, I would not recommend this, or any card from American Express.  0 STARS based on the issuing company.</p>",

The mileage earned for flights - plus the free baggage - is great. I think we've saved HUNDREDS, literally, in baggage fees just this year alone. Even just this Thanksgiving weekend we were thankful for the Priority boarding. It is those little \"perks\" that make this card truly worthwhile. We started using this card as our \"everyday\" credit card, just so we could build up our miles, but have also found that like other American Express cards, the customer service is great, too. Getting the card took a bit longer than we anticipated, but once approved, we had it very quickly, and have been satisfied for the 2 years or so we have had it. We have never had any issues and our miles add up very quickly. The annual fee we thought may be a bit high, but realized it really is not, given what we earn and get back in miles and perks. We do find ourselves even flying Delta more for our business, and when we book the flights using the card, we earn double the points we normally do. This card is definitely worth the annual fee.</p>",

I never had a credit card linked with my WorldPerks Northwest miles, and I knew this was arguably the best way to rack up points, so I took this as an opportunity to start over and start to accumulate points and miles with this card. The initial mileage bonus is generous and what immediately attracted me to this card. I admittedly do not use it enough nor do I fly enough to have any free trips, but I was able to rent a car totally free of charge due mostly to charges I've placed on this card. It's a good card for someone who travels a lot, but I don't know if I would recommend it for someone past the first year. There is no annual fee for this period, and if you cancel within the first year, you can still keep your mileage bonus. Just my two cents.</p>",

My other card offers cash rewards, but no miles. Plus, there's a tiny part of me that likes having an Amex card, just for the sake of having one. Anyway, because I have a main credit card that I love, I didn't use this card as much and didn't gain a huge amount of miles beyond the initial bonus over the time I've had it, but it still managed to make one trip this year basically free. Because of the fee and because I get generally more useful rewards from my other card, I wouldn't recommend it unless you plan on using it fairly frequently and like flying Delta. Fortunately for me, Delta is the only airline I've ever used to travel back and forth to my parents' house, so it's been helpful in that regard, but I can't escape the feeling that I don't use it often enough to justify the annual fee. This isn't necessarily a reflection on the card, more on my card-usage habits, but maybe you're in a similar boat as me. I fly frequently, but not frequently enough to make this my main card, which in turn makes it less rewarding to own. Vicious cycle, anyone?</p>",

American Express has always treated me as a human rather than a customer, or potential money.  They are always on top of what's going on and there to help.  For travel purposes and great  travel rewards redemption this card is hard to beat.</p>",

Sign up and get 30,000 Skymiles after  my first $500 in purchases and also get priority boarding on Delta flights along with a free checked bag.  I wasn't entirely impressed with the interest rate, but the annual fee was waived for the first year, so I decided I didn't have anything to lose, but a lot to gain.  Now I have received a lower interest rate and the customer service is great.  I love their website as it is well designed and easy to use.  I have pretty much decided this card is worth keeping, though when the time comes for a renewal I will definitely look for something without that annual fee.</p>",

I frequently fly with Delta for business and pleasure, so it was a no-brainer for me to pick a Delta rewards card instead of the many other options out there. The $95 annual fee stinks, but I accrue enough Skymiles each year that it is worth it for me. If you don't often fly with Delta or you will be using the card minimally, then this is probably not a good card for you. The AMEX customer service has been awesome!  They are really good about flagging potential fraudulent transactions and notifying you about them. I have also had to dispute a couple of charges and they have been so easy to work with! All in all, this card is great for me because I earn so many Skymiles (and regularly use them), but I would recommend doing an analysis to see if it is worth it for you with the $95 annual fee.</p>",

The main reason I signed up for it was for the 30,000 mile bonus, which is great because it's essentially a free flight just for using this card for an easy amount of purchases to accumulate ($500 in 3 months).  Before canceling my account, I called and asked if they would waive the fee, but they wouldn't, so I canceled it.  If you're looking for a credit card that you can easily take advantage of for the introductory rewards and then get out of before any fees kick in, this is the perfect one.  As others mentioned, if you fly a lot the fee could be worth it, but for me it wasn't.</p>",

You are able to board early with some of the priority people so that is a plus as well.  The APR isn't outrageous for a rewards card, something like 14-15%, but I pay off my balances every month as it is.

We got 30000 miles for signing up, and if you spend $500 in 3 months with them, you get another 30000.  They offer free bag checks which is great, and the miles don't expire or have blackout dates they can't be used on.

This may seem like nothing to many folks, but for me personally it saves a lot of cash since baggage rates are ridiculous nowadays.

Every experience I\u2019ve had with customer service has been pleasant and helpful; my only other complaint is that it still seems as though many smaller merchants are hesitant to accept American Express.

        "content": "<p>I feel like a lot of people see a credit card offering a free flight and jump at it bc it seems really great.  And while it is great, you\u2019re looking for the most value, so it\u2019s important to see what else is out there before applying.  I\u2019m not trying to discount the Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express but am just saying that it might not be as simple of a decision as you might think.  To help you make this decision, here\u2019s what in my opinion are the Delta SkyMiles Credit Card\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br /><br>Pros<br /><br /><br>-\tFree Flight -  You get a free Delta flight from spending $500 in the first three months, which is pretty good.  If you\u2019re looking to benefit on summer travel though, I\u2019d probably go with a rewards card that offers an initial bonus after your first purchase.<br /><br>-\tFree Checked Baggage -  This isn\u2019t a draw if youre not a loyal Delta passenger because other airlines like Southwest offer free bags standard, but if you fly a lot with a large family, having 9 free checked bags could save you a lot of money.<br /><br /><br>Cons<br /><br /><br>-\tOngoing rewards:  When you consider the fact that a card like the Capital One Venture gives you basically 2% cash back on all purchases, getting 2 miles per dollar on Delta purchases and 1 mile on everything else doesn\u2019t seem all that attractive.<br /><br>-\tPriority boarding and in flight savings:  Who cares that much about getting on an airplane first, and even with 20% savings, the stuff your going to buy in SkyMall is still going to be expensive.<br /><br /><br>When you get down to it, I\u2019d say that the Gold Delta American Express Credit Card is a pretty good option for loyal Delta customers who fly at least a few times a year with big groups.  If you\u2019re just looking for a free flight and you don\u2019t care who its with though, I might go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the British Airways Card instead of the Gold Delta SkyMiles Amex.  The Sapphire gives you $500 to spend on travel or $400 cash and the British Airways Card gives you a free roundtrip transatlantic flight.</p>",

For your excellent credit, this card provides 30,000 bonus miles when you charge $500 in the first three months, which are good for a free Delta flight.  Up to 9 people on each of your Delta reservations can also check their bags for free and you receive 2 miles for every dollar spent on Delta purchases and one mile for everything else.  You also get 20% off in-flight purchases, which could be a perk if there is a good duty-free deal, but not if you just buy something from SkyMall.  The priority boarding isn\u2019t really a benefit because what does sitting on a plane for longer really get you? <br /><br /><br>When you get down to it, youre probably only going to get the Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express if you are a frequent Delta flyer.  Other airline affiliated cards offer at least one free flight, so that\u2019s not unique.  A card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred offers a points bonus worth up to $625 in airfare, which you can use on any Star Alliance airline.  The 2 points per dollar spent on travel and dining and one point on everything else also beat the Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card.  All in all, I\u2019d only recommend getting the American Express Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card if you fly a lot and mostly (if not all the time) with delta.  Now aren\u2019t ya glad you were cautious?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Most of American Express\u2019 business cards are charge cards which means you need to pay your balance in full every month, but the Jet Blue Card from American Express Open is one of the few business credit cards Amex offers.  If you are a Jet Blue customer/small business owner, you may be highly inclined to get the Jet Blue American Express Credit Card and if you aren\u2019t you may be scared off by the branding, but either way it really comes down to what the Jet Blue Credit Card offers.  When it comes to rewards, the Jet Blue Amex Card offers 10,000 TrueBlue points with your purchases (weird that they\u2019re points not miles, but who really cares since you get a free flight out of this initial bonus) and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.  While a free flight is nice, the ongoing rewards offered by the American Express Jet Blue Credit Card doesn\u2019t quite measure up.  This is especially true when you consider that the card doesn\u2019t offer a 0% rate on purchases, doesn\u2019t allow balance transfers and has a $40 annual fee.<br /><br /><br>If you want an Amex card there are plenty of alternatives to the JetBlue Card.  For example, the American Express Simply Cash Credit Card is a good offer, as is the gold charge card.  Another good business credit card to consider is the Capital One Spark Cash for Buiz since it offers 2% cash back across all purchases.  Finally, remember that whether you get the Jet Blue Amex Credit Card or another business rewards card, you shouldn\u2019t carry a balance on a business credit card.  You should instead use a personal credit card with a long 0% intro rate like the Citi Diamond Preferred Card.</p>",

It was raised to $16,000.  I have always paid my bill on time, and I have always paid more than the minimum amount due.  When the economy started to go down the drain in the latter half of 2008, I got a letter stating that they had cut my credit limit to $7000.  Every single time I made a payment, they cut my limit again.  For example, if I paid $500, they sent another letter stating my limit had been cut by $500.  It was unbelievable since I had NEVER been late on a payment.  My credit score at the time of all the credit limit cuts was 762.  On top of that, their rewards program isn't anything to get excited about.  I don't use the card, although I still have it.  I never got rid of it simply because I have a very low interest rate on it and can use it in case of emergency.  That said, I don't use it, and won't use it unless absolutely necessary.  My husband and I paid off all our credit cards last year and I don't want to get in debt again.</p>",

Frm the time we recieved the card our credit did nothing but improve but each time we made a large payment on our American Express Clear card, they lowered our credit limit quite a bit, usually by the amount that we paid. Upon calling to inquire as to why this had happened, we were told that if we made a second $5000 payment, they would raise our limit by $300. This card is a joke. A complete joke. I have never been so unhappy or unsatisfied with a credit card company before. We also have cards with several other large companies and have chosen to only use their cards and to stay away from American Express at all costs. We have never missed a payment or been late on anything including American Express and we now make a lot more money than we did at the time we received the card. It amkes absolutly no sense but once that card is paid off, it's being cut up. American Express is done collecting money form us. We will stick with Capitol One who has a better customer service and much better incentives.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Sometimes it\u2019s abundantly clear that a rewards credit card is a good deal, other times its far less so.  In the case of the Clear Credit Card from American Express it\u2019s easy, and that\u2019s not a good thing for Amex.  Though the Clear from American Express Credit Card requires excellent credit for approval, it only offers 1% cash back, allowing you to redeem every 2,500 points you accrue for a $25 American Express shopping card.  One percent cash back is not competitive in todays excellent credit credit card market (1% is the industry standard base rewards earning rate, but the best cards supplement it with even more lucrative rewards on certain types of expenses.  General-purpose shopping cards/gift cards also tend to have fees and service charges not found on store issued gift cards as well, meaning the rewards you earn with the Clear from American Express Card might not even be as lucrative as you might think.  Sure it also offers 0% on new purchases for 12 months, but that\u2019s not so special when you consider that a few other cards offer 0% for as long as 21 months.<br /><br /><br>For those of you looking for a good, simple cash back card, the Capital One Cash Credit Card is a good choice because it offers 1.5% across all purchases.  The Cap One Venture Card is also a good option if you like to travel because miles can be redeemed for any travel related purchase at a rate that makes this card basically a 2% cash back card.  The Chase Sapphire Preferred is the other recommendation I\u2019d make for the rewards crowd since it offers $500-625 as an initial bonus and has an attractive base rewards structure.  For those looking for 0% on either purchases or transfers, check out the 0% Citicards, as there are three that offer 0% for 21 months on both types of transactions.  Whichever of these cards you choose, youre bound to be better off than if you got the American Express Clear Credit Card,</p>",

        "content": "<p>Going green is en vogue in the business community these days.  Green is the color of money.  Getting an idea of what American Express was going for in naming a card the Business Green Rewards Card from American Express OPEN.  But does the Green Rewards Card live up to its connotations, that is the question.  Well, first of all its important to point out that it is a charge card, which really isn\u2019t a big deal for a reason I\u2019ll touch on in a bit.  When it comes to rewards, the American Express Business Green Rewards Card offers 5,000 bonus points after your first purchase, which is nice but not great, as well as 1 point for every dollar you spent, 2 pts for dollars spent through Amex Travel, and up to 10 pts at retailers through Amex\u2019s online mall.  As you may know the extra points via Amex\u2019s mall or travel booked through Amex aren\u2019t really a big deal because prices for whatever you buy will likely be much higher than you can find elsewhere.  It\u2019s therefore clear that the Business Green Rewards Card from American Express OPEN doesn\u2019t give you enough green to be worth it.<br /><br /><br>An alternative for ya:  The American Express Simply Cash is a good option because it gives you 5% cash back on office supplies and wireless services, 3% cash back on, and 1% cash back on everything else.  Your cash back is also automatically added to your statement each month.  This card paired with the Citi Simplicity Card (or one of the other personal Citicards offering 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months) makes for an excellent business credit card strategy.  As alluded to earlier, you only need a business card for purchases that you will pay for in full on a monthly basis.  Business cards do not have protection under the credit card law that prevents issuers from increasing rates on existing balances without cause.  Personal credit cards do not increase your personal liability, so there\u2019s no reason not to adopt this approach.  Besides, if you pick the cards I just laid out, things will be exceedingly \u201csimpler\u201d than if you were using the Business Green Rewards Card.</p>",

I know I probably sound like an idiot for not knowing that but someone I managed to rack up close to $2000 after buying all that I needed for the house plus furniture. But it actually worked out okay. I could not pay it all up front, but I got on a payment plan. American Express withdrew $200 from my bank account on the last day of each month, and after 10 months - I had the card paid off and still got to keep all of the things that I had purchased from my new place. I did cancel the card but I would definitely open one again in the future when I am more prepared and have more money to pay it off every month.....</p>",

They offer good programs, but unless you travel most of them aren\u2019t that great.  We couldn\u2019t justify the cost each year to keep the card, when it\u2019s only purpose was to build credit.  However, if we decide later to travel, we will likely pick it back up.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I first got my American Express card when I moved into my own place. There were a lot of things that I needed for my house and it was nice to have the opportunity to purchase what I needed without having to spend the money up front. I quickly learned that American Express is a charge card, not a credit card. I know I probably sound like an idiot for not knowing that but someone I managed to rack up close to $2000 after buying all that I needed for the house plus furniture. But it actually worked out okay. I could not pay it all up front, but I got on a payment plan. American Express withdrew $200 from my bank account on the last day of each month, and after 10 months - I had the card paid off and still got to keep all of the things that I had purchased from my new place. I did cancel the card but I would definitely open one again in the future when I am more prepared and have more money to pay it off every month.</p>",

        "content": "<p>A lot of people don\u2019t include charge cards in their rewards credit card search, which is odd because charge cards are technically credit cards.  Obviously, charge cards are generally for people with excellent credit and they require that you pay your balance in full every month, so they aren\u2019t right for everybody, but they often have better rewards than traditional credit cards.  From name alone, you\u2019d therefore have to be encouraged by the American Express Green Card.  I mean, it could be good for the environment or give you citizenship or something, but that\u2019s doubtful since a card offering those things would definitely have a higher annual fee than $0 in the first year and $95 thereafter.  Unfortunately, you\u2019re bound to be disappointed by the Amex Green Card.  It only gives you one point per dollar spent, 2 points for every dollar in travel purchases via American Express travel, and 10 points when you shop at www.membershiprewards.com/earn.  The latter two things don\u2019t really count either because credit card company run online shopping malls typically charge higher prices than you can find elsewhere, so these rewards offered by the American Express Green Charge Card aren\u2019t really rewards at all.<br /><br /><br>So what cards will give you more green than the Amex Green Card?  When it comes to charge cards, the Amex Gold and Platinum Cards offer much better rewards, but also come with steeper annual fees, so you would have to determine how much practical benefit you\u2019d get from these rewards and how much it\u2019d be worth to you.  When it comes to credit cards, it really depends on your biggest expenses, but cards like the Capital One Cash Credit Card, which offers 1.5% cash back across all purchases, and the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, which offers a $500 initial rewards bonus, 2 points per dollar on travel and dining, and 1 point on everything else, would both be better options than the American Express Green Card.</p>",

Just for starters, I received a free checked bag when I travel ($25 each way) and I think it is up to 8 people who travel with me can also check a bag free. I also enjoy the benefit of boarding early in Zone 1 which is very nice since overhead room can be hard to come by. Finally, the best benefit of the card is the fact that I get  a free domestic voucher for someone to fly with me each year!</p>",

Some places still don't accept American Express so that can make certain purchases difficult.  This might not be the best card for young people but if you can swing the annual fee and would use it enough to make the miles worthwhile, I highly recommend getting this card.</p>",

That is almost a free ticket within the United States and I am very happy about that. I think that is going to save me a lot of money on my travels.

        "content": "<p>The Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express is yet another credit card offering a free flight just for signing up.  Well, at least that\u2019s what you might think at first, but apparently you only get the 25,000 bonus miles necessary if you add 2 authorized users to your account, which most people won\u2019t do.  It\u2019s not all bad though because you can start redeeming at 10,000 miles, which would get you $100 off a Delta Airlines ticket.  That means the annual fee you have to pay with the Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express ($150) would be offset during the first year by the 20,000 bonus miles you get after your first purchase.  Aside from its initial bonus, the American Express Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card gets you a free companion ticket each year, a free checked bag each time you fly Delta, and at least 1 mile for each dollar you spend.<br /><br /><br>The question of the hour remains though:  Should you get the Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express?  That depends on two things:  whether you have excellent credit and whether you fly often and exclusively with Delta.  American Express has basically targeted its entire credit card business to people with excellent credit, so applying for this card without a long, basically impeccable credit record would be a mistake.  Also, since you want rewards you can redeem often, only Delta Frequent Flyers should even consider getting the Platinum SkyMiles Credit Card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Small business owners have a lot of important decisions to make and which credit card(s) to use for company spending is merely one of them, so I\u2019ll try to make this little review of The \u201cNew\u201d Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express Open a short one.  First of all, it\u2019s important to point our that the Amex Gold Business Card is a charge card, not a traditional credit card, which means you need to pay your balance in full every month.  That\u2019s actually a good thing though, for two reasons:  1)  The CARD Act does not apply to small business credit cards so you shouldn\u2019t use one to revolve a balance anyway 2) charge cards often have better rewards.  Speaking of rewards, the American Express Gold Business Card offers 3 points for every dollar you spend on airfare, 2 points on advertising, gas and shipping, and 1 point on everything else.  You also automatically save 3-10% on every purchase you make through FedEx, OfficeMax, Hertz, etc.  Therefore, it offers you good rewards on some of your most important expenses.  In this regard, it passes the test, so to speak.  Obviously, interest rates don\u2019t apply to charge cards, so let\u2019s move to the American Express Open Gold Card\u2019s fees.  It doesn\u2019t have a membership fee during the first year and while it charges $175 beginning in the second year, the rewards and membership benefits are likely worth it (enhanced spending tracking and management features, purchase and travel insurance, roadside assistance, etc.).<br /><br /><br>Nevertheless, you may want some alternatives.   The Capital One Spark Cash for Business and the Citi Platinum Select Credit Card are good options for everyday purchases and revolving debt, respectively.  Whether you choose one of these cards or American Express\u2019 Gold Business Charge Card, you really can\u2019t go wrong (as long as you use them for the right kinds of transactions).</p>",

We have even been able to convert our points into frequent flyer miles, which helps us considerably when traveling. It was easy for us to track the amount of points we had through the Hilton website.

The Centurion (black) might have a few more perks, but the $2500 annual fee really takes the fun out of it.  The benefits are excellent and I've used most of them. <br /><br /><br> Some balk at the $450 annual fee.  To be honest, if you travel at all, the annual fee can pay for itself in a single trip.  Getting a free room upgrade at a hotel, and a free night covered 3/4 of the annual fee right there.  Saving the cost of a $50/day pass to the lounge on the outbound and inbound flight made up the rest of the annual fee.  Not to mention the breakfast credit, $100 hotel credit, free car upgrade rental, etc.  <br /><br /><br>If you don't travel, but want the service of AmEx, stay on green or gold.  If you travel, this is where you want to be. If you have a 7 or 8 figure income, go ahead and move to Centurion.  You're more likely to use that private jet service than us lowly platinum folks.  :)</p>",

It is very good for anyone who travels because the card gets really great hotel discounts and travel benefits. It also makes your travels more relaxing because you can take advantage of airport lounges around big cities in the world. My father travels extensively and he has been happy with what the card has offered him to make his travels more relaxing. This is a wonderful credit card to have if you travel often.</p>",

The membership miles program is an added plus, I have flown around the world using points transferred to Delta Airlines.  I also transfer the miles into my Starwood Hotel account for discounts on hotel stays.  The only real thing I do not like about it, is the large yearly fee (for two cards it runs me around $600).  I do wish they had a cheaper fee so I wouldn't get slapped with such a hefty payment every September.</p>",

I also enjoy the customer service from American Express.  Everytime I have called them they have been helpful and I get an answer to any question I might have very quickly.  This is the only card that I have right now and it has been worthwhile to have it.  I also have found that it is great for your credit score if you keep up with payments.  I just purchased a new car and got a very good rate.  Also the entertainment options are great, such as restaurants and also airline benefits.  I have only flown once since having the card but I got some very good rewards.Overall I am impressed with this card and am pleased that I got one.</p>",

American Express is the king of business credit cards, and the Platinum American Express is the best of their card family that you can apply for (The American Express Black is something else entirely).  American Express gives exemplary benefits and protection for business travelers around the world.  This card also gives you access to 600 airport priority lounges around the world, saving money on memberships with the various airlines.  The entertainment options this card offers are exemplary too.  Having this card gives access to the American Express Concierge service, with access to all of the best shows, restaurants, etc.  This is the best card to pull out when you want to make a serious impression.</p>",

The 3 non-Amex cards have no yearly fee but it is much harder to accrue points on them.I use my Amex most because of the extended warranty protection (they replaced a phone and a printer in the years I've been with them), ease of disputing charges, 1 bag free, companion ticket, pay with miles program and ease of accruing miles. I'm okay with the fee because I get much more value than I pay for the card. One thing I have never understood over these many years is what benefit MQM's are? What do I get if I accrue these? I've never seen a feature/benefit statement on any literature or offers. Overall, this is a great card for me.</p>",

While it is true that I use the card for my larger out-of-the-ordinary purchases, I also find months where I use it only for run of the mill every day needs and still find that my points rise pretty fast.  There is a requirement that the balance is due every month, which I have never had a problem with meeting.  Redeeming the points is also very easy, doable online.  When I did need to have some customer service help I found them to be attentive and reasonable.  I'm happy to write a positive recommendation for the American Express Platinum Card.</p>",

The card offers many helpful benefits for travelers, such as extra discounted tickets, hotel and resort bonus programs (offering exclusive upgrades and other features worldwide). On the negative side, the card has a $450 annual fee (at the basic level), and a $35 late fee (or 2.99%). The points system the card uses basically gives 2 points per booked travel trip, as well a 1 point for every other dollar spent, which is quite nice.</p>",

My company offered me the card so the annual fee was waived which is pretty high at $450 a year. The new benefits are excellent. I received 25000 reward points for spending $2000 in the first few months of owning card which is huge benefit. I travel heavy sometimes and the card offers annually up to a $200 refund on any airline fees such as baggage fees. The Platinum Concierge is a great luxury. On my last trip, the hotel lost my reservation. I call concierge and within in 10 minutes they book me a room a mile down the road at a much better hotel with a nicer room at no extra charge. I highly recommend this card even if you personally have to pay the annually fee out of pocket. The card easily pays for itself.</p>",

They seem to be too by the book and are often not willing to be flexible. They are very by the book and all business. Something is missing in this approach to customer service. I will likely cancel my account and seek out a bette company to do business with. There are so many good credit card companies out there, that you should expect only the best customer service and benefits. I will be doing a little shopping around in search of a better deal. I like WalletHub as it offers a wide range of opinions on a variety of credit card products. This has been a big help.</p>",

I started with the Gold card and was offered an upgrade to Platinum about a year after that and have loved it ever since.  The annual fee is definitely a little steep but it comes along with great benefits and rewards and I've never had a problem disputing charges.  Actually, in most cases American Express has gone and fixed the problem themselves before I've even called.  I've also done some of the members only events and they were amazing.  I took a one night cruise just for cardholders for the christening of the Norwegian Gem cruise ship where John Mayer performed in a very intimate setting, and Bobby Flay designed the menu and on board for a book signing.  I especially love that you can now use your points for almost any rewards you can think of, and if its not specifically on their list they will figure out the point amount for you so you can get whatever you want.  You can now also pay your bill using points as well.  This is a great card that I use almost everywhere I go.  Highly recommended.</p>",

My dad also has the same card and he got some kind of deal for both my brother and me!  The annual fee is about half because my dad actually pays the full amount.  I feel a little above my means using the card, because at the full $450 price, I really doubt that I would have been able to afford it at all since I am still in school.  I do travel home to and fro from home to college quite a bit so the access to private lounges is really nice.  Despite the perks of the card, it does have a real downside that I just cannot overlook. Often times, I will go to pay at a small businesses establishment, and it turns out that they just do not accept American Express at all!  This is kind of annoying to say the least, because I really like little out of the way restaurants and botiques.  I think this card is really for the more well off person who visits mostly areas where businesses all accept American Express.  This is also the reason, that I may just have to get another card, because I can only carry so much cash on me...  Another great thing about the card that I adore is the points!  Personally, I don't have enough to get anything fabulous, but my dad amounts enough to get something cool every now and then.</p>",

The strengths of this card alone far outweigh any negatives like the $450 annual fee. For example, there is a terrific concierge service, an airport lounge program, and several promotional opportunities. Then there is also protection features like the 3 month coverage from theft, and protection on many items you purchase. You can also send an item to Amex for a complete refund minus shipping if the initial retailer refuses to take an item back, and at up to several hundred dollars per item, which is great for items with no return policy. Customer service has also been absolutely brilliant, and at least as far as I'm concerned, these experiences alone have validated the high value of the credit card.</p>",

I love the customer service that the company provides whenever you call, and I love that when I upgraded from my Gold to Platinum card, they prorated the annual fee (and even gave me back a little bit as a \"thank you.\") One of my favorite things about the card is the sense of security I have whenever I travel with it, as I know that American Express will take care of me if something bad happens with my card. I love that I can get access to the Admirals Club with American Airlines as a perk for this card. When I travel, I like to be in a quiet, relaxing place before I get on my plane. Also, I love the \"Destinations\" magazine you get with your Platinum card, as I love to read about traveling and culture in general. If I had to get rid of all of my cards except for one, I would keep my American Express card hands down!</p>",

Last year I went abroad, with help from the airline travel I received from the card, and American Express made it easy for me to get in contact with them and even easier for me to keep track of my funds. I would say the best thing about the card is the company that it is based through, I really feel like the people who I contact are there to help me. Recently, I had some trouble with a certain seller charging my account for items I did not purchase. I called American Express and less than a week later I got a email telling me that the charges were taken care of. All in all I love this card but I mostly love the company and what they are willing to do for their clients.</p>",

The rewards are also great. Twenty-five thousand bonus points just for spending 2 grand! That's awesome! I always feel like I'm getting something special when I earn points, and there are always extra ways to earn them. I also love that they don't expire which was a major problem I had with lesser cards. Overall, I think the annual fee is very reasonable considering all the perks you get.

        "content": "<p>Dear Margie and Joe.  I have one question. I notice u guys commenting a lot on these cards, an I wonder whether you have used them yourself? <br /><br /><br>I have previously owned this card, when I was doing hardcore travelling.  As Margie spelled out nicely, this is a wonderful card to have, if you travel often. Lounge certainly is great, but to be honest, if you are someone who can afford $450 annual fee without flinching, that means you either fly higher class cabin (thus you get lounge anyway), or you are probably high tier member for many airlines, and u get lounges anyway.   <br /><br /><br>so why is this card good? <br /><br /><br>BESIDES the pros and cons Margie already listed  except:<br /><br /><br>1) 200 airline credit is flat out awesome. You somehow packed too much, and airline charges you money?  No problem. Put it on amex plat, and they give you back.  had to make changes due to unforseen circumstances? no problem. amex plat got your back. <br /><br /><br>2) while Margie put this as cons,   their \"glorified\" customer service - aka concierge service is great. You need anything ANYWHERE around the world? just call the number on the back, (they give you number to call for each country, so you don't have to make international calls for 1800 number), and they can direct you to anywhere, and assist as best as they can.    I used its service and found them to be so valuable, and each story will be too long to list. <br /><br /><br>3) Margie is wrong, in that amex DOES have shopping mall, and having amex plat gives you opportunities to earn   4x, 6x, and sometimes 10x points. <br /><br /><br>4) if you are a fan of exclusive privledge, and high-end resort and hotels,  this card can help you tremendously. <br /><br /><br>So what's the final verdict here?   Let's be honest WalletHub.  This card is geared toward high spenders. The prestige that comes with owning amex plat is significant.  Its like people asking why do you drive Benz when your good ol' Scion can get you there just fine?  Same thing. This card has that special feeling.  You have to ask yourself if you are worth it to get this card at $450 per yr. (no first yr free too! sheesh). <br /><br /><br>why do I say let's be honest WalletHub?  It's because WalletHub gets referral fee for people signing up for credit cards. But there are already other websites that cater toward high spenders/prestige group that either have/or be exposed to this card already.  <br /><br /><br>i think the major target group for WalletHub is either newcomers or those who need 2nd or 3rd card,  and not a charge card that on average annual spending is close to $180,000.  Yes , that's the average spending each person makes on their amex plat, who owns this card. <br /><br /><br>So unless you aim to put about 80-100k on this card per yr,  its not worth it.</p>",

In my opinion, probably none, but I guess we will see because that\u2019s what the Platinum Card from American Express charges.  Anyway, I don\u2019t believe the Amex Platinum Card is actually made of platinum so that theory is out.  That seems like two negatives compared to zero positives, but let\u2019s give the American Express Platinum Charge Card a fair shake.<br /><br /><br>Pros<br /><br /><br>-\t25,000 bonus points when you spend $2,000 in the first three months.  Since you can get a $250 statement credit with 36,000 points, that sure is a pro.<br /><br>-\tAirport lounge access is certainly a nice amenity for frequent travelers.<br /><br>-\tA free companion ticket will also bring a decent amount of value.<br /><br>-\t$200 in airline credits for incidental charges will also come in handy for frequent travelers.<br /><br>-\tGetting a points discount when you redeem for travel is pretty good too because you\u2019re going to do so as much as possible. <br /><br /><br>Cons<br /><br /><br>-\tThe ongoing rewards aren\u2019t special.  If I'm going to pay $450, I want more than 1-2 miles per $1 spent.<br /><br>-\tThe whole concierge service offered by credit cards is just a glorified customer service and I wouldn\u2019t give it much weight.<br /><br /><br>Overall the Platinum Amex Card gives you a lot but it takes a lot too.  You really need to sit down and monetize how much each of the cards \u201cperks\u201d would actually amount to and compare this amount to the annual fee.  If they\u2019re worth less or the card doesn\u2019t provide as much value as say the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card ($500-625), then I wouldn\u2019t get it.  And I'm guessing that the Amex Platinum Card does not.</p>",

        "content": "<p>You know, people don\u2019t really talk about charge cards that often, but they are actually pretty popular among those with excellent credit scores.  The reason for this is that charge cards often have some of the most lucrative, interesting rewards attainable with plastic, and that includes rewards credit cards (the only difference between a charge card and a credit card is that you have to pay your bill in full every month w/ a charge card).  American Express is one of the most active major credit card companies on the charge card market, and The Platinum Card is one of the companies premiere charge cards.  The first thing that you probably notice about The Platinum Card from American Express is that it has a $450 annual fee.  That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a bad card though because banks sometimes charge high annual fees in return for extra rewards, meaning whether or not you get this card depends on if the rewards it offers are worth at least $450 a year to you.  <br /><br /><br>In terms of rewards, American Express\u2019s Platinum Charge Card offers enough bonus points after you spend 1k during the first 3 mo. to get a roundtrip domestic flight.  It also gives you $200 in Airline Fee credits each year, a free companion ticket with a first class or business class ticket purchased through Amex\u2019s travel services, airport club access, and deals on upgrades at hotels.  Then there\u2019s the typical 1 point for every $1 you spend with the Platinum Card from American Express and double points for trips booked online.  I\u2019d have to say that this stuff does seem pretty valuable IF you travel very frequently and you like to do so in style.  Still, if free flights, airport lounge access and hotel upgrades are what you\u2019re after, there are likely cheaper options out there.  The Southwest Airlines Credit Card is currently offering 2 free flights, so that\u2019s at least one offer worth checking out.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have had this card for several years now (not sure exactly when I got it, but has been at least 7 years) and I use it for a wide variety of purchases.  They've raised my limit a few times without me even asking, which has been great for larger purchases (which yield lots of points).  No annual fee is great and I've been able to pick up some great items with my reward points.  The biggest reward I was able to get was a Kitchen Aid Mixer for my wife.  I've also just recently been able to get a toddler bed for my daughter using only points.  The points certainly are what drive my use of the card the most.  The interest rate is not great so I try not to keep a balance on it for very long.  I haven't run into too many places that didn't accept American Express, but there have been a few (always for small purchases, though, the larger purchases have always been on my American Express).  I also love the year end reporting that I get from American Express.  My purchases are broken down by category and I can really get a good picture of my spending habits.  The only thing that would make the report better is if I could use my American Express everywhere and actually track all my purchases, rather than having some be on a different brand of card.  Overall, though, I am very satisfied with this card and plan to keep using it for a long time, especially as long as the points keep coming.</p>",

I've had to contact them about fraudulent charges a few times and the customer service was amazing at resolving my issues and getting a new card out to me. One thing that has started to wain on my use of the card is that American Express just isn't accepted as much as Visa. I lived abroad for two years and had a very hard time using my American Express Blue Card and had to opt for a new card that didn't charge foreign transactions fees and was more widely accepted. Besides that, a great card for those who know how to properly manage their money.</p>",

I told them that I was traveling and could use my Visa, so just send it normal mail. The rep I talked to said that they'd overnight it to me where ever I was. The next morning my card was in my hands. Amex removed the charges from my card and dealt with the vendor; with my Visa I had to prove to them that I didn't make the charges.

Blue for American Express gives you 10 points per $1 spent on purchases made through Amex\u2019s online shopping mall, 2 points per $1 when booking travel through Amex and 1 point per $1 on everything else.  The 1 point per $1 is all you should really count on though because online shopping malls and credit card run travel programs don\u2019t usually have the most competitive prices so rewards on those types of purchases aren\u2019t worth too much in a practical sense.  When it comes to rates, the Blue Credit Card from American Express gives you 0% on purchases for 12 months, which is fine, but certainly not on the high end of the spectrum with other cards considered.  Therefore, though the Blue American Express Credit Card does not have an annual fee, it\u2019s still not competitive with the best offers on the market.<br /><br /><br>If a no annual fee credit card is what youre after, there are myriad good options.  A card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred doesn\u2019t have a fee in the first year and gives you a $500 \u2013 625 initial bonus for spending $3k in the first three months.  The Capital One Cash credit card gives you 1.5% cash back across all purchases and a $100 initial bonus.  The Citi Simplicity Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 18 months.  Keep in mind though that paying an annual fee is often the price of getting the best rewards.</p>",

I found this card on a blog (can't remember which one) and found out that 20,000 dollars spent would be worth 25,000 miles on American Airlines.  This was the highest conversion rate I could find so I went for this card.  American Express is a top-notch company and I have been very pleased with their professionalism and have felt I've been treated by them very well.  I have since purchased a business and routinely charge about 8 to 10 thousand a month which makes earning miles very easy.  I can also use those points to stay at Sheraton hotels.  I would definitely recommend this card for anyone wanting miles or hotel points.</p>",

So far so good with the card, I earn 1 point for every dollar I spend with the card, sometimes up to 2 points per dollar if I shop at one of their partner retail locations.  It may not be my favorite card (that goes to the Costco True Earnings Card by American Express) but I still pull it out from time to time to earn some points.  My fiancee and I are planning a pretty big vacation after we get married so these points will come in handy.  I definitely enjoy the luxury that Starwood Hotels is known for so that is a plus in my book.</p>",

There are two Starwood hotels onsite at Disney, if you stay there you get most of the Disney hotel benefits (transportation to and from parks, etc.) but you can use your Starwood American Express card points to stay.  Additionally, I recently lost the card and when I called to report it, the customer service representative was wonderfully helpful and knowledgeable. I received my replacement card quickly. I also like that there are so many hotel choices and few blackout dates.   I also utilize their online payment and the Amex app on my phone.

We have accumulated so many points combined, that whenever we go away at our own leisure, the room is totally covered. We also use this card for our regular purchases (gas, utilities, etc), so we get even more points that way. If you don't stay at least a couple of weeks at Starwood Hotels (W, St Regis, Aloft, Element), then this might not be the best card for you. The customer service is top notch as well, and we have never had any issues to report thus far.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is a great credit card. I first heard about it when a family member recommended it to me. I originally signed up as a favor to him (he got 5,000 Starwood Preferred Guest points to his account), but I didn\u2019t have a strong opinion about the card at that point. To my surprise, I got 25,000 points myself for signing up! So yes, they have a GREAT referral program. <br /><br /><br>I was able to use the points in many different ways. The most common use of the points is for hotels. I have gotten hotels in Kauai, Hawaii; Malibu, California; and Brooklyn, NY. They have so many different places where they have hotels. There are different tiers of hotels ranging from good to great. You usually need anywhere from 2,000-12,000 points to get a night\u2019s stay at a hotel. There\u2019s also the option of using points to lower the price of a hotel; this is a mixed option, where you pay some cash and use some points. In addition, I have also used my points to book airline tickets. American Express allows you to transfer points to almost any major airline. Because I am a Delta frequent flier, I transferred 40,000 miles over to my account. The great plus to this option is that American Express will give you a bonus 5,000 miles for every 20,000 miles you transfer. Essentially, I got 50,000 miles when I only transferred 40,000 miles. <br /><br /><br>The only con to this card is the $65 annual fee, which is automatically charged to my card.</p>",

Yes, if you don't fly a lot, this might not be for you, but even if you take a cross continental domestic flight, this is golden. <br /><br /><br>spg has so many transfer partners, its not even funny.  american? check. United? check.  Non-US carriers? check check check. <br /><br /><br>if you transfer in bulk, say 20,000 spg points,  then u get 25,000 miles,   which is great!<br /><br /><br>you don't have to stay at sheraton 6-8 times a year to make this card awesome. even once is great.  Since, starwood has awesome hotels in wonderful and exotic locations like Bali, Koa Samoi,  or even  one of my favorite    Mystique, Santorini-Greece,    using these points for that purposes is going to make your dream come true. <br /><br /><br>this card ALWAYS stays in my pocket, if I am in the states. Sadly, this card does have forex charge, so when I travel, it stays at home, sadly waiting for my return.</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you\u2019ve ever stayed at a Sheraton, a Westin, or higher-end hotels like The W or the St, Regis, you\u2019ve stayed at a Starwood hotel.  If you stay at any of the hotels under the Starwood umbrella (also includes Le Meridien, The Luxury Collection, Aloft, Four Points, or Element) exclusively when you travel, it might make sense to get a Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card from American Express.  First of all, the American Express Starwood Credit Card offers 15,000 bonus points (10K after first purchase and 5k after spending $5,000 in first 6 months), which is redeemable for 6 free nights at the company\u2019s Category 1 and 2 hotels (list available online).  That\u2019s a pretty darn attractive initial bonus for someone who knows their going to be staying in such hotels in the near future.  You also get at least 4 points per dollar spent on Starwood Hotel stays with the Starwood Credit Card from American Express, 2 points per dollar spent at Starwood retail partners, and 1 point on everything else.<br /><br /><br>Earlier I said that the Starwood Credit Card \u201cmight make sense\u201d because the fact that you are a loyal Starwood customer doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Starwood credit card will be your most rewarding choice.  There are a lot of really good rewards cards out there, particularly for people with excellent credit, which is what it takes to open the Starwood Preferred Guest Amex Card, since Amex\u2019s entire credit card business is targeted to the upper crust of consumers.  So, if you don\u2019t spend at least 20 nights in a Starwood Hotel each year, you shouldn\u2019t consider opening this card for anything else other than its initial bonus.  And if you aren\u2019t going to need 6 free hotel nights in the next year, I\u2019d go with a card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred that offers an initial bonus of either $625 in travel accommodations or $500 cash over the Starwood Preferred Card.  If you do stay in Starwood Establishments for 20+ nights, by all means go ahead and get the Starwood Credit Card, as it will help you save on one of your biggest expenses.  I\u2019d probably also get a good everyday cash back card like the Capital One Cash card to use for all of your other purchases.</p>",

Alternatively, you can either as for that or ask for a credit increase, but I don't think that they will do both at the same time.

The interest rate is standard or high depending on your credit, and the annual fee of $75 is a bit high, but if you take advantage of all the extras the card offers with discounts and services it will even out in the end and you will actually be gaining more even though you are paying a high yearly fee.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I got the American Express Blue Cash card about a year ago. Let's be honest. It's okay. It's not amazing that the company hasn't stolen all your money from hidden fees. That should be expected. I don't like that they don't offer 0% on transfers. Otherwise, it's a decent alternative to the standard bearers Visa and Mastercard. If you're able to use an American Express, in particular an American Express Blue Cash Preferred, then you'll probably get better deals than with a Visa or a Mastercard. At times it's only competitive with Discover. I just wanted to let people know what's up because other people are practically saying it's the best thing since sliced bread and I like a little bit of honesty served up with my reviews.</p>",

After spending $1,000 on my card within the first 3 months, I received $150 as bonus reward. Their cash back rewards program is simply awesome and it helps you earn unlimited 1% cash back on virtually everything you buy. Moreover, there is no annual limit to your cash rewards. You earn 6% cash back for your purchases at U.S. stand-alone supermarkets; 3% cash back for gasoline at U.S. stand-alone gas stations and select major department store purchases. I use it primarily for groceries and gas and trust me I do save a great deal. The only negative thing is their annual fee of $75 which is not waived for the first year. However, by using your card very often you can easily get far more cash back than the annual fee. I highly recommend it to those who want to earn the highest cash back rate possible as this card is the best in the market.</p>",

I think I only experienced one place that refused it, which was good anyway because I really didn't need the splurge, anyway. It was a great card to use as a student. I was in grad school when I first got the card and making very little as a grad assistant while living on campus. This card was great for emergencies. It was nice to know that I had a reliable source of funds if the need presented itself. The cash back feature is also nice, but I really never used it enough to benefit too much from that feature. I also think American Express has great customer service. I'm extremely satisfied with Blue from American Express.</p>",

You would need to spend $1250 in groceries at supermarkets just to break even with this card and I really didn't like that.

At, first, I wasn't too keen on the 75 dollar annual fee; but, after doing the math I'll easily be making more than that back, just in cash back from grocery purchases. On top of all of that, I like the fact that it's an American Express. There is still a small amount of prestige in having this card.</p>",

Another thing about this card is the purchase protection American Express offers.  I was on vacation in Miami, Florida and the first night I was there my rental car a Cadillac Escalade was stolen from the hotel parking lot.  I needed to rent another truck right away but my credit limit was at its maximum.  I called American Express and explained my situation and they temporarily extended my credit limit so I could rent another vehicle.  I was very impressed.  They even sent me flowers when I got home from my vacation saying how sorry they felt about my situation.  Love this card.</p>",

For the most part, it's features outweigh any fees, etc. The main reason I got it was the rewards/cash back, but also because the interest was lower than any other card I've had in the past. For every thousand dollars spent, you get a pretty decent amount of reward dollars, and while that was a plus, it's somewhat outweighed by the fact that you have to pay an annual fee to use the card. The fee isn't exorbitant but when you're a student, pretty much any annual fee on the card hurts your wallet. Still, the rewards were pretty handy, especially the 2% back at gas stations, which was far better for me than the 'standalone supermarket' cash back.</p>",

I was in another country when I was having breakfast with my friend at a out-of-the-way \"quant\" breakfast restaurant. However, I paid the bill and then my friend looked at the receipt and realized that I had been charged nearly 10 times the actual value of the meal. On the final receipt, the decimal point had been moved over several times. This sounds crazy, but it actually happened. We were almost 30 minutes away when my friend realized this, so we had to drive back. I talked with the manager and they said they had it resolved, but come a month later I still have that charge. I had told Amex I was going to be traveling in this country, so I realize why I wasn't alerted to this purchase. However, Amex was able to get my money back from the restaurant, which was a huge relief. It was a bizarre situation and I was glad to have the customer service from this card in my corner making sure that I wasn't charged the outrageous amount for this meal. So, overall amazing customer service.</p>",

I was coming from a bare-bones Visa that I was given right after turning 18, which had no reward structure of any kind and which I had been maxed out on for years. It was an awful experience.  I finally paid it all off, and I wanted something with good rewards that I could pay off every month and still make a little return on.  I've found that the 6% back at grocery stores adds up very quickly, and their customer service has been fantastic. I've never used the reward structure for anything except the cash back, but that's exactly what I was looking for anyway. There are still some places out there that don't take AMEX, so you may not be able to have this as your only card, but when you use it where you can (especially grocery stores and gas stations), it's great. Highly recommended.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have had the Blue Cash Preferred for a year now and I am nothing but thrilled with both the cash back and the service American Express provides. If you spend a decent amount on groceries, the 6% back on groceries alone makes it worth the $75 annual fee (this is in comparison to the no annual fee Blue Cash Everyday that gives 3% back on groceries). The 3% back on gas and department store purchases is just icing on the cake for me (I don't spend much on gas). As for the customer service, American Express is extremely helpful on both the phone and by email. Email usually receives a response within a few hours. This card has become my everyday card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have the American Express Blue Cash Preferred card and I prefer it to other cards I've had.  I have a nice low APR.  Yes there's an annual fee, but that is more than made up for by the generous rewards program.  I use this card for all of my everyday needs such as gas and groceries and my rewards add up very quickly!  I love the wide variety of rewards that are available - there is a large selection of gift cards, quite a few electronics and other actual items that you can purchase with your points, or you can choose cash back and get a credit on your account.  I let my rewards add up and then buy gift cards for Christmas shopping, but that's just me.  I like that I can choose how and when to use my rewards.  Another thing I like about this card is the website.  It is so easy to view and manage my account and they have a very easy to use program for categorizing and tracking your spending.  I have had a couple other cards in the past that had similar programs, but they were not as user friendly as this American Express one.  Overall I have had a great experience with this card and plan to keep it for many years to come.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is a great credit card. I use it primarily at the grocery store because it pays a rate of 5% on all groceries. Once I surpass the $6500 threshold of spending in a calendar year, my rewards rate also increases (from 1% to between 2 and 6%, depending on the type of purchase). Anyone who is forced to make everyday purchases such as gas and groceries would benefit financially from this card, as you are receiving money back for things that you would be forced to buy anyways. Everyone should be careful to pay the balance promptly, because the variable rates after the introductory period can be substantially high, as is the case with most credit cards.</p>",

I usually draw the line when it comes to applying for anything that has yearly fees, but I was tempted by the $150 free for making $1,000 in qualifying purchases in the first three months.  I achieved that easily, and did get my bonus, but it felt like two steps forward and one step backward, because the $75 came out of this reward.  I also was able to get no interest for a year after signing up, so it quickly became my \u201csafe\u201d card to put larger purchases on while I saved up to pay the sum off in one go.  I felt that even after the first year was up, I would be coming out ahead by earing 6% cash back on my grocery purchases.  But I often shop at stores that are not recognized solely as supermarkets, so my purchases never get classified under the 6% returns, but instead under the 1%.  This has really slowed down my accrual of cash back, and after the \u201choneymoon\u201d year is up, I don\u2019t think I will be continuing with this card.  I don\u2019t really use the perks that come with an American Express card, as I am not interested in luxury items, but rather how to stretch my dollar a bit further.</p>",

I applied, and received zero percent interest for twelve months, along with a $150 bonus for spending $1,000 in the first three months I had the card (easy to do, just pay your everyday bills with the card!). So far, I'm very pleased with the ease-of-access and manageability of my account online, as well as with American Express' customer service. It's a very straightforward and simple-to-understand rewards system, and I love that the higher-earning cash back categories are for purchases I make regularly such as at grocery stores and gas stations! Those categories really add up! Of course, the interest rate is on the higher side, but that is to be expected with a rewards card of any type. You just have to be careful not to carry a balance! All in all, this is a great card to use!</p>",

I contacted my bank ahead of time so there would be no problems when I was there and to alert them to expect foreign charges on my credit card. When I arrived in Nairobi, Kenya at my hotel, I gave the front desk my credit card but it was rejected. I was sure it was a mistake so they were kind enough to call AmEx for me. AmEx had canceled my card because of my attempt to use it in a foreign country, despite my previous call. Apparently, there was no communication with their website and the Visa website, which had input my information. I was extremely disappointed in the bank's actions and argued. Eventually, they were able to re-activate my card. However, this experience seems to be common with AmEx and if you are traveling abroad, I would highly recommend using another credit card. Aside from this experience, my use of it in the US has been satisfying and the rewards are good.</p>",

It's also more widely accepted than my Discover card. My only complaint would be that it can sometimes be difficult to redeem your points, but it's not too terrible a hassle.

I guess we don't use this card enough to get the RIGHT kind of \"cash rewards\" because every time we've tried to USE the so-called \"cash rewards\" we've been met with truculent obstructiveness by their so-called \"Customer Service\" people. We tried to use our \"cash rewards\" to buy theatre tickets and, even though that kind of use was approved IN WRITING by American Express, when it came time to actually buy the tickets, we had to go through this ABSURD rigamarole nonsense that ultimately ended with us NOT being able to use them.  It was a real disappointment because we couldn't afford the theatre tickets otherwise. American Express is a greedy corporation interested only in lining their CEO's pockets with their customers' money. Their rates are WAY too high and choosing this card for so-called \"rewards\" we can NEVER use was a MAJOR mistake. We paid it off, cut up our card, sent it to them, and told  American Express what they could do with the resulting detritus. So, whatever you do, do NOT buy into their ridiculous, nonsensical corporate line shown on this website! \"Integrity?\" Nope. \"Respect for people?\" Nope again. \"Customer Commitment?\" You gotta be kidding me.</p>",

I also like the Shell station deal which is the $5 back on a purchase of $25 of gas, which is really helpful since I always spent over $25 on gas anyway so it is always nice to get some cash back. I also like how it is partnered with ticketmaster so that you have pre-sale access. That is an extremely convenient feature especially since my boyfriend and I love to go to games often.

The first thing we noticed when we were looking for a credit card as we wanted to make a smart choice was the rewards! You get 6% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations - who doesn't want money back at a gas station with gas prices nowadays? Plus, you get 1% cash back on purchases every where! It was those rewards that pulled us in. We liked that there was no Earn/Redeem limit, too. The only downfall was the annual fee, but I have no problem paying the annual fee if I am getting those kind of rewards in return. Another thing we liked is that when we mentioned the card to our friend who was looking, they signed up too and got approved and we received a referral bonus. <br /><br /><br>I should mention you need to have excellent credit to get approved for this card. We also have contacted customer service at American Express with questions and they were very helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I usually give my business to a company that can answer my questions and don't give me the runaround and I'm happy to say American Express did none of that! They made sure we got our answers and we didn't have to go from person to person. So, if you are looking for a card that has awesome rewards, friendly customer service, I would definitely recommend this American Express card!</p>",

        "content": "<p>My girlfriend and I wanted to get a joint card after moving in together, and chose this one.  We have been very happy with it so far - the 3% back on supermarket purchases was our primary motivation, and the 2% back on gas is great for when we take trips.  American Express also has the best user account page that I've ever used - it quickly and beautifully breaks down all your purchases, and makes it very easy to see both how we are spending our money, and also what rewards we are accruing in a given month.  And it's very easy to simply apply the reward back to our account bill automatically, which is also nice.<br /><br /><br>The only thing I fear with this card is late payment fee - it's huge.  We are vigilant in paying off our card each month, but that looming 20% fee is cause for concern.  Also, Amex customer service is kind of strange - they're almost too friendly.  They profusely thank you for giving them your year of birth, which just weirds me out.  Granted, that's a pretty minor complaint.<br /><br /><br>In summary: a great card for household purchases and everyday reward credits.  I spent hours researching options, and have no regrets with this choice.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This was the first credit card I ever got while I was in college. I started off at a low credit limit but as I made payments on time and gained credit the limit increased. I really like this card because it has many perks that come along with it. For example, this month they are offering $5 back on a purchase of $25 of gas at Shell stations. Since gas is something that you need to buy anyways, it\u2019s just an added perk to get $5 back. They also have a great cash back program that you can redeem after you\u2019ve reached a certain mark (I think it\u2019s $50, but I can\u2019t remember). I think that the best thing about this card is the pre-sale access to ticketmaster.com. Many shows open the AMEX presale days before tickets go on sale, which gives me the opportunity to get great seats before anyone else. This month they are also offering $25 back when you spend $75 at ticketmaster. The only draw back to the AMEX is that is isn\u2019t offered everywhere like Visa and Mastercard. All in all I think that this is a great card and don\u2019t know what I would do without it!</p>",

Any time I've asked for a credit limit increase, they've granted it without hassle.  <br /><br /><br>The best part of my experience regarding this card has not been the cash back, it's been AMEX's customer service in the identity fraud department.  I use this card very frequently (often multiple times daily) to purchase online, buy groceries, eat out, and a variety of other uses.  You name it.  Imagine my horror when I had my identity stole not once, not twice, but THREE times in a six month period.  AMEX called me and caught the fraudulent charges, before I was even aware of them, all three times.  I didn't even have to dispute the charges.  They knew it wasn't me due to location and the type of stuff being bought, and cancelled them as soon as I called in to confirm that I was not the one making the purchases.  <br /><br /><br>AMEX gets an A+ from me.  Oh, and the large amounts of cash back are nice too.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I initially applied for this American Express card because I was purchasing a new laptop and knew that they would double the warranty on it. Unfortunately I had to exchange my laptop in the store, and due to a difficulty with the exchange they retailer was not able to do the transaction on the same receipt. Because I had a new receipt with a new computer, Amex would no longer honor the warranty policy on it. I was hoping I could work with Amex customer service and provide documents showing that I had simply exchanged the computer and hopefully still get covered, but because of the problem with the receipts they could not help me. This was disappointing since the nitial charge on my Amex was not reversed and I was still paying them off for this purchase (the problem was that the computer listed on this charge no longer matched the computer I wound up with due to the exchange). <br /><br /><br>I still plan to use this card for purchases on things that I would benefit from an extended warranty on, but because of my past experience, I have concerns about what technicalities might come up that would void this program.</p>",

On top of that, I really like the design of the card, and have actually received quite a few compliments.  I just wish that American Express could be accepted in more places to take further advantage of the 1% on everything else!

I have not had the opportunity to refer any friends as of yet, but with 75 dollar incentive, it's worth a little effort. Some may complain about the annual fee, but with great money management, the fee breaks down to a little over seven dollars a month yearly.  With the rates of bank fees for checking accounts these days, I would say that seven bucks is better than 12 bucks a month. And most banks don\u2019t offer a cash back option. All in all, I love this card.</p>",

        "content": "<p>People often make a big deal out of the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express and for good reason; it offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else.  Great card, no doubt about it.  I just like the Blue Cash Preferred Card from Amex better, and it\u2019s not because the word \u201cPreferred\u201d is thrown into its name.  It\u2019s because I am content paying a $75 annual fee in return for getting 6% cash back at supermarkets, 3% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on  everything else.  I mean, I\u2019m going to use my credit card regardless and I\u2019m confident that the more lucrative rewards structure offered by the Blue Cash Preferred Card will give me enough free money in the long term to more than make back my $75.  This is especially true since the Amex Blue Cash Preferred also gives you a $150 initial bonus.  The Blue Cash Preferred even gives you 0% on purchases for a year!<br /><br /><br>Don\u2019t get me wrong, from where I\u2019m sitting this card has its weaknesses.  I mean, not everyone can get it since you must have excellent credit for approval.  There\u2019s also no low balance transfer rate, and as quickly as the annual fee will pay for itself, we\u2019d all obviously prefer that the Blue Cash Preferred Amex Card not have one.  With no annual fee, you\u2019d feel no obligation to use the Blue Cash Preferred regularly and could instead save whenever you wanted to make purchases with plastic.  But if you have the proper credit standing and could use a good rewards card for your everyday expenses, you can\u2019t go wrong with the benefits provided by Amex\u2019s Blue Cash Preferred Credit Card.</p>",

The caveat there is that payments made during the monthly cycle do not get the discount reward. That's an important distinction that will not necessarily be clear to anyone reading about the card and I think you should know that. I now realize that if I pay \"too early\", the discount doesn't apply. I was very disappointed. AMEX charge cards may not have a preset limit but they do have limits based on spending patterns. If I have $5000 available and use that in the first week of the monthly cycle on unforeseen expenses with several auto-debits still to come, I need to pay down the balance quickly within a few days and thus NOT get the discount on that payment. The discount only applies to the ENDING BALANCE. Now, if you have a stratospheric limit on the card, it won't matter. But for many small business owners juggling expenses and spending limits while trying to get maximum rewards, this can and will be a nuisance. Applicant beware.</p>",

The Blue Cash Everyday Card is definitely one of the better options for those that don't use their American Express card a ton.  The main reason being that this AMEX card does not have an annual fee, which is very common for AMEX.  It also does included rewards too.  I would recommend trying to reach the $1,000 threshold in the first three months for your $100 reward, essentially making all your initial purchases at 10% cash back.  Then just using it as you need it.  Me and the wife pretty much just use our card for when we go to CostCo, as they only accept American Express and we were tired of stopping at the bank every time we wanted to go shopping there.</p>",

You will pile up rewards quickly if you do a lot of grocery shopping for your family. Also, they have excellent first year deals and NO annual fee, which is amazing. If you only have one credit card, you can always add a second by getting the AMEX Blue card. There's no risk and it only rewards you for getting it.

        "content": "<p>I think one of the best features of the card is that you can get cash back starting at $25 and then you can use more than one on the same bill. I make sure to get a $25 cash back credit as soon as I hit $25 so it will be waiting for me by the time I make my next payment. I also think the website is pretty easy to use. I've never had problems submitting a payment or looking at my bill. The only downside is the really high APR once the 0% intro rate expires. I'm going to try to pay most of my balance before my 0% rate expires because 20% interest is just too much.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The American Express Blue Cash Everyday is the best credit card available for consumers and its my favorite credit card to use. This card gives me great cash backs and their always a promotion going on that would allow you to earn rewards from using this card. The American Express Blue Cash Everyday allows you to earn rewards on everyday purchases. If you drive your car everyday you may put gas in it everyday as well, this card gives you 2% back on gas purchases. When you purchase groceries you receive 3% back, you earn 2% back for department stores purchases, and 1% back on other miscellaneous uses. I work part-time an go to school full time and the rewards this card offers helps me tremendously. Also this card does not have an annual fee and you have the flexibility to pay it over time. There is no spending minimum, no enrollment, and no rotating categories for you to earn cash back. Also, if a merchant does not accept a return of one of your eligible purchases, American Express will refund the purchase price. You can manage your account online and a number of tools is available for consumers who use American Express online. Also, you won't be held accountable for any fraudulent charges. This is the best credit card I have and I highly recommend it due to its amazing cash back rewards program.</p>",

I love the fact that I get more of a cash-back return when I use it to buy groceries and gas since those two categories are high dollar categories for me. I also recently discovered that they offer complimentary 'extended warranty' service on certain purchases and even complimentary roadside assistance! I rarely run into situations where a vendor doesn't accept American Express so we try to use it as much as possible. One thing that I like that changed over the past year or so is that now you don't have to wait until the end of the year to receive your cash-back rewards.  You can apply your rewards to your balance at any time throughout the year which is really nice. For the amount of reward dollars that we've been able to accumulate throughout the course of using this card, I can't believe that everyone doesn't take advantage of this.  It's like getting free money for buying stuff that you'd normally buy anyway!</p>",

        "content": "<p>The American Express Blue Card is hands-down the best credit card I've had and used. The sign up bonus is incredibly generous, but where this card really shines is the rewards. A credit card isn't worth it unless you get something back, and this AMEX gives it back in spades. A lot of the other credit cards I was looking at had reward categories that encouraged more spending than I should be doing (movie theaters, department stores, travel, etc), and I'm trying to stick to a budget. Other cards had rotating categories for rewards so I never knew what I should be spending. The Blue Card is straightforward - 3% on groceries, 2% on gas (and department stores) and 1% on everything else. How great is that? Groceries and gas, the two things every person spends money on anyway, and they are giving you cash back for it permanently, all year around. And 1% on everything else means that I've moved all my expenses to this card, and I'm getting amazing rewards each month. I can't recommend this card enough to other people.</p>",

I really love the website interface that comes with the card too. It makes it very easy to track expenses and to print backup for my expense reports at work. I've found the interest rate to be a bit on the high side compared to some other cards I have, but I find that is typically the case of cards with good rewards...I suppose that extra interest helps pay for the rewards.</p>",

I believe that you get $100 for the first $1,000 you spend in the first three months. Also, you receive a specific cash back percentage for purchases spent on food, gas and clothing! That is basically all I purchase anyway so this is a perfect fit for my lifestyle. American Express is excepted at most retailers including Costco, which is a plus since they do not except any other form of credit.</p>",

That is outstanding compared to many other \u201crebate\u201d cards who only pay out in points which you later need to redeem before they expire. Or you can only redeem for lame items like some half-useless thing from China that obviously might have cost the company $1 to aquire in the first place.

I also received a big cash bonus when I signed up for the card which was a nice benefit. I use this card all the time especially for the bonus categories.

He was being deployed after we moved and because of his service they were super helpful when I accidentally missed a payment. We LOVE the rewards program. We bought our airline tickets for a visit home through the rewards program, and it didn't cost us a penny. I have not had a single problem with my card, and the customer service is great.

Thankfully, they changed that not too long after I opened the account (I think Amex realized that their customers weren't too happy with having to reach an annual spending threshold just to earn the 5% max). Instead, they came up with the idea of splitting it into 2 new cards, a Blue Cash \"Everyday\" and a Blue Cash \"Preferred\" (both with a simple non-tiered formula). I believe they still offer the old Blue Cash card but I switched my account over to the \"Everyday\" as soon as it was available (mainly because this one has no annual fee). Now I don't have to worry about cash back restrictions every time I go to use my card, or about having to make sure I'm signed up for those revolving cash back categories every month. This is also the only card I've ever had that gave me 3% on all supermarket purchases and that really comes in handy. I use this card every time I go grocery shopping and it pays off big time (I save the money I earn in cash back bonuses for Christmas every year). They pay existing customers $25 for every friend that is referred and I've earned $75 so far! I highly recommend checking out their \"Blue Deal\" page online too because customers can save alot of money on their partner deals. All in all, this is a really great card and with one of the best cash back programs around.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I use this card mainly for the rewards. I\u2019ve compared to some others, but most cards seem to be either a flat 1% on everything or 1% on all purchases with a rotating category that is worth 5% for about a month at a time. I feel that the rewards on this particular card are much better than that. 3% on groceries, 2% on gas, 1% on everything else is a much better deal, especially since the vast majority of my purchases are either groceries or gas. Not having an annual fee is basically a must for me to even consider a particular credit card. As for the interest rate, I pay my balance off monthly, so I don\u2019t even notice. Honestly I couldn\u2019t even tell you what my current rate is.</p>",

The reward redemption is good, the minimum cash out as a credit to your account is $25, but they process it very quickly.You can also use the credit for merchandise through their website.</p>",

We originally had an Amazon Chase card, which gave us decent rewards in Amazon.com credit, but we wanted to see if we could get something better. Once we got the Amex card,  I was intrigued at how amazingly high percentage this card gives back, especially when going grocery shopping. We use this card religiously for everything now and pay the balance off every couple weeks. It took about 2 months for rewards to start showing up (had to call Amex for them for it to show up), but once they did, we are completely satisfied by getting about 50-80$ a month in rewards.</p>",

The cash back that they offer is nice but I found that I earned rewards that added up a little faster with other cards.  The rates aren't bad and the customer service is helpful.  Overall, this is a nice card to have, and you can often get one with a low credit line to help you get your credit established.</p>",

It's a great card and American Express has out of this world great customer service. We had a small issue with an autopay going through twice and they fixed it and put my mind at ease in the process. I recommend this card to anyone who is looking for a great card where you earn a little back as you spend. It's especially great if you pay your balance off in full each month. Highly recommended!</p>",

The base cash back of 1% is nothing outstanding, but there's no minimum you have to spend before you get the 1%, and no annual fee. The purchase protection and extended warranty and all those extras that come with an AmEx card are what pushed me to use this card whenever possible instead of my bank's 1% cash back credit card. Also nice are the higher cash back percentages (2% for department stores and gas, 3% for groceries).</p>",

I use this car primarily for business and it has made me be able to open up new accounts and not having a reoccurring bill until the merchandise sells.

Notwithstanding the warranties from the particular retailers I frequent, I find that Amex typically provides superior coverage.  Moreover, the built-in insurance for rental cars and travel is piece of mind I quite enjoy.  Apart from the base benefits that all American Express cards have, the cash back option is stellar.  I\u2019ll say that again, receiving cash is far superior to any point system other cards offer.  Typically, I\u2019m able to redeem a $25 credit per billing cycle.  My only caution would be that this card is best for those that tend to spend a couple thousand dollars a month on the credit card to maximize the rewards.</p>",

In fact I just bought a new desktop computer and laptop with it. And if you spend $1000 in the first month then you get $100 bonus. The cash back percentages on gas and groceries is also a huge plus since I love to cook and spend alot of money at the grocery store each week. My work is also far away and I have to spend alot of money on gas so the cash back it gives on gas is great too. So far the blue cash everyday card has proven to be an excellent card and I would recommend it to anybody that wants to get a new card with great cash back program.</p>",

Mostly, I love the rewards that I am eligible with this card.  I get 3 percent cash back on grocery store purchases as well as 2 percent cash back on gas stations.  Considering that I hardly go out to eat at restaurants and that I have a considerable commute to and from work everyday, I fell like this is a great card for me.  Also, I have found that American Express customer service is the best that I have had to deal with out of all my cards.  They are always helpful and courteous, especially considering that I only contact them whenever I have a problem.</p>",

Throughout college, this was my go to card to every place that accepted American Express. Sadly however, there are still many places that don't accept American Express. The Cash back system is always a bonus despite not being as high as other cards but back then, especially being a broke college student, every penny counted. Overall, I would definitively recommend this card to anyone who wants a card to start building credit and has a pretty good cash back system.</p>",

In terms of the rewards, it's always a bonus that all my spending will result in a few extra bucks a month that I can use on food, movies, or gas. Best of all, it's cash back and not some lame points system. The card also looks pretty neat. The only con about this card is that not every place I go to takes American Express which is quite difficult at times especially for people who only carry this card.

The cash back isn't a lot of money but I figure it's a bonus for using a card that I was using anyway.  With no annual fee and a decent rate, I highly recommend this credit card offering to anyone.  It can be hard for someone with little credit history to qualify for an American Express card, though.  They seem to be a little harder to convince to give you an account but once you have some credit established, definitely add this one to your financial arsenal.</p>",

Also, for whatever reason Amex decided to give me a fairly low credit limit compared to my other cards. Still, the real reason you get this card is because of the benefits of working with Amex. Their customer service is excellent. The card will extend warranties longer than most others. I find that most places accept Amex these days too, but there is the concern that Amex charges the highest credit card processing fees to merchants. For that reason, I tend to avoid using it at small businesses.</p>",

Almost all of \"our\" credit had been in my ex-husband's name, so establishing credit on my own was something both my parents and my lawyer suggested I do right away. In the industry I work in, I knew a lot of people used American Express, so I looked them up online and decided to apply. I knew what credit I had was already very good, so the application process was very easy. I don't like filling out forms online, so I called and spoke to a Customer Service Rep, who was very helpful. I did have to wait on hold for a while, but once on the line, he (I don't recall his name) was helpful and listened to what I needed. I received the application and packet in the mail later that week, and after returning everything, was approved almost immediately. I was very pleased with the introductory rate of 0%, and decided to make some needed purchases for my new home, which would not only help me establish this credit on my own, but give me a chance to pay everything off while still using the 0% interest rate.<br /><br /><br>I now use this as my \"everyday\" credit card, and all of my gas purchases. I try to pay it off in full every month, but when I do carry a balance, my interest rate is much better than the other card I have.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This was the first credit card I ever got while I was in college. I started off at a low credit limit but as I made payments on time and gained credit the limit increased. I really like this card because it has many perks that come along with it. For example, this month they are offering $5 back on a purchase of $25 of gas at Shell stations. Since gas is something that you need to buy anyways, it\u2019s just an added perk to get $5 back. They also have a great cash back program that you can redeem after you\u2019ve reached a certain mark (I think it\u2019s $50, but I can\u2019t remember). I think that the best thing about this card is the pre-sale access to ticketmaster.com. Many shows open the AMEX presale days before tickets go on sale, which gives me the opportunity to get great seats before anyone else. This month they are also offering $25 back when you spend $75 at ticketmaster. The only draw back to the AMEX is that is isn\u2019t offered everywhere like Visa and Mastercard. All in all I think that this is a great card and don\u2019t know what I would do without it!</p>",

The trade ins for point are kinda random sometimes and don't necessarily give you the best bang for your buck. You can also redeem your points earned (1 point per $1) for travel rewards and in that regard they are very similar to all the airlines rewards cards.  I thought it was a fine card because of the rewards but some of the categories weren't as highly rewarded as the Costco AMEX on the things I buy more frequently, so that's why I switched (3% at supermarkets instead of gas, 2% for gas and dept stores versus travel and restaurants, and 1 % for everything else).  The APR on these types of cards are relatively high so make sure to pay off your balance each month or there's really no sense in earning rewards.</p>",

        "content": "<p>My husband and I have had the AmEx card for quite a while. It was his idea; frankly, I try to avoid getting credit cards because they always seem to be burning a hole in our pockets, if you know what I mean. It's SO easy to \"forget\" you eventually have to pay for what you've charged...and then some! We got the card for our online business' exclusive use: buying postage, office supplies, and...most importantly...more books to sell in our bookstore. So that means we're almost constantly spending money. After several months of using this AmEx card I realized it was sort of paying for itself IF looked at from ONLY that perspective. Yes, the no annual fee is what made it most attractive but getting the cash back is pretty darn cool, especially for a small business like ours! The drawbacks are, unfortunately, there as well. First of all, there's the interest rate. We're paying their maximum of 22.24% and that sucks BIG time. AmEx apparently was wary that our bookstore didn't have a credit history all its own so, even though it's a sole proprietorship, insisted that if we wanted their card we'd have to pay the maximum fee. This really ticked me off because OUR individual credit histories and scores are really good and the bookstore is, after all, a SOLE proprietorship, NOT a corporation. The other thing that bugs me about AmEx is that if you don't pay 100% of the principle by the due date...which they prefer way more than other credit card companies...you get penalized. So what we've wound up doing is having to scrupulously pay 100% of the principle by each month's due date, then putting aside the cash back \"rewards\" to help pay for the following month's billing. It doesn't puzzle me what AmEx is trying to achieve by this business strategy...most consumers, they've obviously found...are too stupid to realize there really isn't a reward in the \"cash back\" concept when you have to pay 100% of the principle each month. Most people will rack up a big bill expecting big cash rewards every month when, in fact, the money you get \"back\" only goes to pay AmEx eventually. I've decided that we're getting rid of this card by the end of the year and finding something better with a lower interest rate...at least a credit card company that will regard our bookstore as part of US and not as a separate entity.</p>",

I started out with a not so great Capital One card since I had no credit and it didn't have the best rewards program. So, as soon as I built up enough credit, I got the blue cash everyday card from American Express and I use it exclusively for groceries so I can take advantage of the 3% returns. I also like that the reward comes in cash rather than points or miles, and it has a high limit and no annual fee. The only thing I don't like is that the reward is low for most purchases. I spent over $1000 on groceries at supermarkets and earned the 3% as well as a hundred dollar bonus. If you travel a lot, you should consider getting another credit card that offers better rewards for travel. For example, with the delta skymiles card from American Express, you can earn 2 points for every dollar spent on travel. Overall, I think it's a great card if you use it only for purchases at supermarkets and gas stations, but if you're looking for one credit card to use all the time, you can do better.</p>",

And you know what, it does, the American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card is a great offer that does give you great rewards on the purchases you make the most, grocery stores, gas stations, and of course shopping at department stores.  And we can all see that it gives you $100 bucks essentially for singing up.  But I\u2019ll give it the ol\u2019 pro con list treatment anyway.<br /><br /><br>Pros<br /><br>-\tGood rewards for recurring purchases.<br /><br>-\tThe fact that the rewards are cash rewards (more straightforward than points or miles).<br /><br>-\tNo annual fee to offset the value of the rewards.<br /><br /><br>Cons<br /><br>-\tThe only bad thing about this card is that it isn\u2019t the best at what it does.  The Amex Blue Cash Preferred is just a better Amex Blue Cash Everyday Card than the Amex Blue Cash Everyday Card is.  Yes, that card has a $75 annual fee, but it also gives you double the rewards as the Blue Card Everyday.<br /><br /><br>So, overall, I gotta say that the American Express Blue Cash Everyday is a great card, but its cousin is just a bit better.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Who wants to get blue money everyday?  It\u2019d be worthless!  Of course I am joking, and the \u201cblue\u201d part of the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express is just the brand name Amex attached to its premier credit card line.  Obviously humor isn\u2019t my thing, so I\u2019m going to get back to something I know rather well, evaluating credit cards.  It pays to know what a card has to offer and how it stacks up against the competition before applying for it, so I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to use my knowledge as a bank officer to help out all you nice credit card shoppers out there.  The Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express is obviously the product Amex has positioned as its everyday rewards card, and it does give you 3% cash back on supermarket purchases, 2% on gas and purchases made at department stores and 1% cash back across all other purchases.  Keeping with the recent tradition of rewards cards offering initial bonuses, the Amex Blue Cash Everyday also offers a $100 rebate when you spend $1,000 during the first three months.  To finish with the basics, the Blue Cash Everyday Card is for people with excellent credit (Amex\u2019s primary customer base), does not have an annual fee, and has a 0% introductory period for purchases lasting 12 months.<br /><br /><br>It\u2019s fair to say that the Blue Cash Everyday Card is one of the best rewards cards on the market.  I mean, there\u2019s a reason that this website has it on their Editor\u2019s Best Page.  This card would make a great card to use for everyday purchases (surprise, surprise) IF you have excellent credit and actually shop at supermarkets and department stores a lot.  If you don\u2019t, there\u2019s no point in applying because you should get a card that meets your credit standing and spending habits.</p>",

(still unconfirmed) I put $250k in my account and let it sit for a month, but they never updated my balance to reflect any interest earned. I tried to withdraw the money to my wife's bank account, which is allowed per their Deposit Account Agreement, but they refused. Even though I offered to provide proof that I have the authority to deposit, withdraw and exercise control over the funds in the account, American Express violated their own terms and conditions and insisted it must be my own personal account in my name that funds were being transferred to. They had absolutely no legal or ethical ground to stand on. I cannot stress enough that nobody should do business with any bank, such as American Express, that doesn't adhere to their own terms of service.</p>",

Received card.  Never activated the card.  Called Bluebird to close account and requested confirmation of closure.  Was told it would be emailed immediately.  Email was never received.  Called a couple days letter and requested confirmation letter again.  A week passed and still no email (yes, I checked spam folder).  Called Bluebird again.  Finally get tech support who sends me a closure letter.  Letter states \"has been closed because you repeatedly tried to add funds from your linked bank account that was not able to be processed.\"  \"\u2022You canceled the transaction through your bank<br /><br>\u2022There wasn\u2019t enough money in your bank account\"  \"This activity violates the terms of the Bluebird Member Agreement\".  THIS IS NOT CORRECT.  Call tech service back and was informed that they only have boilerplate notices that they can generate.  He reads me the list of options he can select.  All options contain verbiage that either reflects poorly on the consumer or implies the consumer did something wrong.   I ask if they have anything that simply states \"This account has been closed at the consumers request.\"  Tech service advised that they do not and since they do not work for American Express and they cannot create a letter.  REALLY?  I've opened and closed at least 30+ accounts in my lifetime and have never had this problem.  SO HAPPY THAT I NEVER USED THIS ACCOUNT!  If the American Express Bluebird banking structure is so inept that it cannot produce a simple closure letter (that any other banking card company is capable of producing) then I shudder to think of the problems others are facing with Bluebird.  I will not be recommending this card to anyone.</p>",

I switched to this account after the 2009 bank bailout crisis as my local bank was merged into a mega chain that I did not like. The main thing that was difficult in transitioning to amex was getting used to _NOT_ having _ANY_ brick and mortar branch to walk into. Making deposits was initially cumbersome, but their new mobile app makes it much easier (ability to photograph checks) and faster than when I first started with them. The _NO MINIMUM BALANCE_ was the major selling factor for me, rarely will you find this in a high yield savings account anywhere else. Love it for non brick and mortar savings.</p>",

We opted for the American Express High-Yield Savings Account because it offered a 0.85% interest rate, which was phenomenal compared to what we had before!  The rate is currently at 0.80%, but we're still very happy with that number.  I was hesitant to use an online bank, but the electronic transfers between our Bank of America checking and this AmEx account are so easy.  I had a brief misunderstanding at the opening of the account and accidentally generated a duplicate transfer from our checking.  I called customer service and was put through right away to a real person who was quickly able to help me navigate the online interface (which is very simple and user-friendly).  So, even though AmEx doesn't have physical banks, I know that I can get good service from a real person if I need it, that the transfers always process correctly, and that I'm earning a respectable amount of interest on a savings account.</p>",

Paying the entire balance off every month saves me any interest I would have to pay with another card and I still have the flexibility to make a purchase and pay for it a month later instead of immediately. The card is excepted just about everywhere and the level of customer service is excellent. Their on-line center is easy to use and provides all the information needed to track purchases, schedule payments and stay updated on Reward points. The fact that AMEX supports Small Business Saturday is also a major plus in my book. Great card, great service. I highly recommend applying.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I do a lot of online banking and after recently setting up and using an AEB account, I have found the bank to be one of the better options. Processes are carried out efficiently, website is easy to use, limits are high on external account use, and customer service, if needed, also is efficient and friendly. The only significant negatives to me so far are that the bank imposes a six business day waiting period on external transfers, which is longer than at least some other banks, and they don't offer online (through email or chat) customer service. Overall, I would place the bank as one of the best handful of online alternatives!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Positives: Fast and fair application process. Variety of medias. Good banking and rates. <br /><br /><br>Negatives: Iffy customer service and problem resolution. Once I dealt with a shady website and some of my information was stolen. Getting in contact with customer service at American Express was a hassle. At the time, I had no online banking. Therefore, I needed to call and get information on my account and get it locked down. However, it took over 2 hours to get the situation handled. In this time, 500$ was stolen from my account. I also had a few minor customer service problems. I cannot say for sure that American Express in general has horrible customer service, but my experiences were poor.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have never had a better prepaid card! This card has a direct deposit option that I use for online work. When I transfer funds, they are there within 1-2 business days. It is very fast, and there are no fees for direct deposit that I've seen. No fees for using the card either! The only fee I've ever seen is for ATM withdrawals and almost all cards have that. It took me a while to get the card linked for direct deposit, but after I did, it was great! This is by far the best prepaid card out there in my honest opinion. Their customer service is really outstanding as well. Hold times on the call were very low, maybe 3 minutes. All in all, awesome!</p>",

I just wanted a card I could depend on if I couldn't quite keep up with bills or rent for a month, and American Express has really delivered for me! It's been so great to have a reliable card, and I couldn't make any really negative comments, other than the usability in different locations may be spotty at some points.  Be sure to have a back up plan! All in all though, great, friendly service, and a great card to have!</p>",

        "content": "<p>I recently got a promotion that would provide me with some extra money every month. I wanted to be a responsible adult and save the money but I wasn't comfortable storing the money with my regular bank because I was afraid I would spend it. I also wasn't comfortable with putting my money in a CD or any other type of hard to access investment. When it came down to it, I picked American Express, I have an AmEx card and I liked that they offered quality customer service as well as one of the highest interest rates available on their High-Yield Savings accounts. Sure, .85% isn't as great a rate as what we used to have in the USA but it's the best today so it did have some sort of influence on my decision. The thing I love about the account is that my money is earning interest, and is still easily accessible in case of an emergency (although there is a 3-4 day wait for withdrawals). The only downside to the account would be the website. It's a bit drab, and honestly doesn't have the easy to use bells and whistles functionality of some sites that offer similar products like Ally or ING. While this isn't a deal breaker by any means, it would be nice if the site was more user friendly and modern but as long as my money is safe, I'm okay with it's basic appearance.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I signed up for the American Express personal savings account about a year ago.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the experience thus far.  When I signed up for it originally they were offering 1.15% APY, which was about as good as I could find for a savings account.  Now it is down to 0.85% APY, but still pretty good compared to what is out there.  The nice thing is it is FDIC insured, there are no minimums and no fees associated with the account.  Additionally I was surprised how quickly the transfers take place in and out of the account.  They literally are next day transfers with no fees.  All in all, I am very happy.</p>",
